There is no benefit in retaining the legacy rate control module
in the driver codebase.

It is known to be buggy and has less than optimal performance
in real-world environments compared with minstrel. The only
reason that it was kept when we made the switch to minstrel
as default was that it showed higher throughput numbers in a
clean/ideal environment.

This is no longer the case and minstrel can push ath9k to
the same throughput levels. In TCP, with 3-stream cards, more than
295 Mbps can be obtained in open air, with 2-stream cards,
210 Mbps is easily reached. To test performance issues,
instead of using a broken rate control module, it is better
to use the fixed-rate interface provided by mac80211 anyway.

The ath9k RC has not received any bug fixes in years and is
just bit-rotting away - this patch removes it.

The svcrdma transport provider currently allocates receive buffers
to the RQ through the xpo_release_rqst method. This approach is overly
complicated since it means that the rqstp rq_xprt_ctxt has to be
selectively set based on whether the RPC is going to be processed
immediately or deferred. Instead, just post the receive buffer when
we are certain that we are replying in the send_reply function.

The code for demoting segments to 4K had some issues, like for example,
when using _PAGE_4K_PFN flag, the first CPU to hit it would do the
demotion, but other CPUs hitting the same page wouldn't properly flush
their SLBs if mmu_ci_restriction isn't set.  There are also potential
issues with hash_preload not handling _PAGE_4K_PFN.  All of these are
non issues on current hardware but might bite us in the future.

This patch thus fixes it by:

 - Taking the test comparing the mm and current CPU context page
sizes to decide to flush SLBs out of the mmu_ci_restrictions test
since that can also be triggered by _PAGE_4K_PFN pages

 - Due to the above being done all the time, demote_segment_4k
doesn't need update the context and flush the SLB

 - demote_segment_4k can be static and doesn't need an EXPORT_SYMBOL

 - Making hash_preload ignore anything that has either _PAGE_4K_PFN
or _PAGE_NO_CACHE set, thus avoiding duplication of the complicated
logic in hash_page() (and possibly making hash_preload a little bit
faster for the normal case).

This is a rather hot function that is called with a potentially NULL
""struct common_audit_data"" pointer argument.  And in that case it has to
provide and initialize its own dummy common_audit_data structure.

However, all the _common_ cases already pass it a real audit-data
structure, so that uncommon NULL case not only creates a silly run-time
test, more importantly it causes that function to have a big stack frame
for the dummy variable that isn't even used in the common case!

So get rid of that stupid run-time behavior, and make the (few)
functions that currently call with a NULL pointer just call a new helper
function instead (naturally called inode_has_perm_noapd(), since it has
no adp argument).

This makes the run-time test be a static code generation issue instead,
and allows for a much denser stack since none of the common callers need
the dummy structure.  And a denser stack not only means less stack space
usage, it means better cache behavior.  So we have a win-win-win from
this simplification: less code executed, smaller stack footprint, and
better cache behavior.

The patch removes all the uses of cpu_is_mx().  Instead, it utilizes
platform_device_id to distinguish the different gpio types, IMX1_GPIO
on i.mx1, IMX21_GPIO on i.mx21 and i.mx27, IMX31_GPIO on all other
i.mx SoCs.

The MSDOS/MBR partition table includes a 32-bit unique ID, often referred
to as the NT disk signature.  When combined with a partition number within
the table, this can form a unique ID similar in concept to EFI/GPT's
partition UUID.  Constructing and recording this value in struct
partition_meta_info allows MSDOS partitions to be referred to on the
kernel command-line using the following syntax:

Commit fb341f57 removed the pte prefetch on guest invlpg, citing guest races.
However, the SDM is adamant that prefetch is allowed:

  ""The processor may create entries in paging-structure caches for
   translations required for prefetches and for accesses that are a
   result of speculative execution that would never actually occur
   in the executed code path.""

And, in fact, there was a race in the prefetch code: we picked up the pte
without the mmu lock held, so an older invlpg could install the pte over
a newer invlpg.

Reinstate the prefetch logic, but this time note whether another invlpg has
executed using a counter.  If a race occured, do not install the pte.

This patch enables rb-tree based extent cache in f2fs.

When we mount with ""-o extent_cache"", f2fs will try to add recently accessed
page-block mappings into rb-tree based extent cache as much as possible, instead
of original one extent info cache.

By this way, f2fs can support more effective cache between dnode page cache and
disk. It will supply high hit ratio in the cache with fewer memory when dnode
page cache are reclaimed in environment of low memory.

On some systems the ACPI NVS area is located in the first 1 MB of RAM and
it is overwritten by the i386 code during the restore after hibernation.
This confuses the ACPI platform firmware that doesn't update the AC adapter
status appropriately as a result
(http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7995).

The solution is to register the reserved memory in the first 1 MB as
'nosave', so that swsusp doesn't touch it during the restore.  Also, this
has been done on x86_64 for a long time now, so this patch makes the i386
restore code behave like the x86_64 one.

The CRQs used by the ibmvfc driver are read and written by both
the client and the server. Therefore, we need to mark them volatile
so that we do not cache their contents when handling an interrupt.
This fixes a problem which can surface as occasional command timeouts.
No commands were actually timing out, but due to accessing cached data
for the CRQ in the interrupt handler, the interrupt was not processing
all command completions as it should.

We have a warning already when support for old-fashioned class based
instantiation is about to be dropped somewhen soon from a driver. Let's
have another one when it was actually dropped. This allows to remove the
cruft a little earlier and still let users know what happened in the
rare case they are missing devices after the change. However, there is
enough interest to get rid of class based instantiation rather sooner
than later because it improves boot up time.

Presently call_usermodehelper_setup() uses GFP_ATOMIC.  but it can return
NULL _very_ easily.

GFP_ATOMIC is needed only when we can't sleep.  and, GFP_KERNEL is robust
and better.

thus, I add gfp_mask argument to call_usermodehelper_setup().

So, its callers pass the gfp_t as below:

call_usermodehelper() and call_usermodehelper_keys():
	depend on 'wait' argument.
call_usermodehelper_pipe():
	always GFP_KERNEL because always run under process context.
orderly_poweroff():
	pass to GFP_ATOMIC because may run under interrupt context.

Access register mode is one of the modes that control dynamic address
translation. In this mode the address space is specified by values of
the access registers. The effective address-space-control element is
obtained from the result of the access register translation. See

Execution"" in ""Principles of Operations"" for more details.

The connection setup phase takes around 2 seconds or longer and in
that time it is possible that the need for an ACL connection is no
longer present. If that happens then, the connection attempt will
be canceled.

This only applies to outgoing connections, but currently it can also
be triggered by incoming connection. Don't call hci_acl_connect_cancel()
on incoming connection since these have to be either accepted or rejected
in this state. Once they are successfully connected they need to be
fully disconnected anyway.

Also remove the wrong hci_acl_disconn() call for SCO and eSCO links
since at this stage they can't be disconnected either, because the
connection handle is still unknown.

All calls to remove_suid() are made with a file pointer, because
(similarly to file_update_time) it is called when the file is written.

Clean up callers by passing in a file instead of a dentry.

On CoreNet based platforms the LAW address is split between an high &
low register and we no longer shift the address.  Also, the target IDs
on CoreNet platforms have been completely re-assigned.

Additionally, added a new find_law() API to which LAW an address hits in.
This is need for the CoreNet style boot release code since it will need
to determine what the target ID should be set to for boot window
translation.

Finally, enamed LAWAR_EN to LAW_EN and moved to header so we can use
it elsewhere.

The CRQs used by the ibmvfc driver are read and written by both
the client and the server. Therefore, we need to mark them volatile
so that we do not cache their contents when handling an interrupt.
This fixes a problem which can surface as occasional command timeouts.
No commands were actually timing out, but due to accessing cached data
for the CRQ in the interrupt handler, the interrupt was not processing
all command completions as it should.

Cleaner would be to pass those feature flags as arguments to
fw_card_initialize() or fw_card_add(), but the FairnessControl register
is in the SCLK domain and may therefore not be accessible while Link
Power Status is off, i.e. before the card->driver->enable call from

The function was not gentle at all to the callers and died without giving
them a chance to deal with possible errors. Rename it to read_gitfile(),
and update all the callers.

As no existing caller needs a true ""gently"" variant, we do not bother
adding one at this point.

Changing uid/gid/projid mappings doesn't change your id within the

on the wrong task.)

Given the write-once nature of these files and the other security

Impact: add new tracing plugin which can trace full (entry+exit) function calls

This tracer uses the low level function return ftrace plugin to
measure the execution time of the kernel functions.

The first field is the caller of the function, the second is the
measured function, and the last one is the execution time in
nanoseconds.

- v3:

- HAVE_FUNCTION_RET_TRACER have been added. Each arch that support ftrace return
  should enable it.
- ftrace_return_stub becomes ftrace_stub.
- CONFIG_FUNCTION_RET_TRACER depends now on CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
- Return traces printing can be used for other tracers on trace.c
- Adapt to the new tracing API (no more ctrl_update callback)
- Correct the check of ""disabled"" during insertion.
- Minor changes...

Much (but not all) of the RTC state is kept in the RTC peripheral which
has its own power domain.  Periodically (1 HZ), that state is synced from
one power domain to the other (peripheral->core).  When we are resuming,
we need to wait for the sync to occur so that we don't get a mismatch of
reading undefined state in the rest of the driver.

Further, once the externally maintained bits have been synced back into
the core, we then need to restore the bits maintained in the core.  In our
particular case, that is just the write completion interrupt bit.

If we don't do any of this, working with the RTC causes ~5 second delays
from time to time after waking up due to the write completion interrupt
never firing.

are SMP-related but still needed on UP.  This incorporates fixes
posted by Olof Johansson and Heikki Lindholm.

cpuset_can_attach() prepare global variables cpus_attach and
cpuset_attach_nodemask_{to|from} which are used by cpuset_attach().
There is no reason to prepare in cpuset_can_attach().  The same
information can be accessed from cpuset_attach().

Move the prepartion logic from cpuset_can_attach() to cpuset_attach()
and make the global variables static ones inside cpuset_attach().

With this change, there's no reason to keep
cpuset_attach_nodemask_{from|to} global.  Move them inside
cpuset_attach().  Unfortunately, we need to keep cpus_attach global as
it can't be allocated from cpuset_attach().

v2: cpus_attach not converted to cpumask_t as per Li Zefan and Rusty
    Russell.

By introducing the use_dac(), set_dac() and DMA_DAC_MASK macros, we can
eliminate a lot of ifdefs from the code.  We now rely on the compiler to
optimise away a few things that we'd formerly relied on the preprocessor
to do.  This makes sym_setup_bus_dma_mask() small enough to inline into
its only caller.
