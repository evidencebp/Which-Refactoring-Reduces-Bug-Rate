38683db41204cb221892beeb88d67a1df4a07287,lxc/lxc,"Split bdev into modules: overlay

With this commit we start to split bdev.{c,h} into modules located in the
subfolder bdev. We start by creating a module for overlay: overlay.{c,h}.

- The functions:

	- overlayfs_detect()
	- overlayfs_mount()
	- overlayfs_umount()
	- overlayfs_clonepaths()
	- overlayfs_destroy()
	- overlayfs_create()

  move from bdev.{c,h} to overlay.{c,h}. The only thing that remains in bdev.c
  is the static definition of

	- static const struct bdev_ops overlayfs_ops

- The functions:

	- update_ovl_paths()
	- overlay_getlower()

  move from lxccontainer.c to overlay.{c,h}. update_ovl_paths() is used to
  update absolute paths for overlay lxc.mount.entry entries but it seems to fit
  more here than into lxccontainer.c.
  The Function overlay_getlower() is used to extract the lower directory for
  overlay (and aufs) rootfs. It should at some point become a common helper.

- The functions:

	- do_rsync()
	- dir_new_path()

   remain in bdev.c for now but become extern. We declare them extern in
   overlay.c to be able to call them. As the comment to them correctly notices,
   they should at some point become common helpers and probably move to
   utils.{c,h} or some other more appropriate place.

- The structs:

	- struct bdev; /* defined in bdev.h */
	- struct bdev_specs; /* defined in lxccontainer.h */
	- struct lxc_conf; /* defined conf.h */

  are forward declared/put as incomplete types in overlay.h so that the
  functions have access to it.

- The header overlay.h is *not* included in bdev.h but only in bdev.c so that
  when bdev.h is included the public functions in overlay.h cannot be accessed,
  i.e. if an implementation wants to call functions from overlay.h they need to
  explicitly include it. (As is e.g. done in the case of lxccontainer.c.)

- The header

	- lxc-btrfs.h

  also moves to the bdev subfolder.

- Adapt Makefile.am to the new bdev layout.

Some streamlining of command option parsing and ssh command
reinvocation for (a) remote control and (b) pseudo cylc-version backward
compatibility.

1) All commands now use the same simplified option parser.
2) Pseudo backward compatibility now works for running (and remote) suites.
3) Remote ssh invocation for all commands, including (optionally) those
that normally connect to remote suites via Pyro.

And some minor changes:
3) Removed the central suite database.
4) Moved lockserver from the control command category to utility.
5) Renamed the maxrunahead command to set-runahead.

ccdf3151b1bcee9f4a5f7114e11853220affe55c,cylc/cylc,"Improve stall logic in presence of clock trigger

Before this change, if the suite has any clock triggered tasks, the
suite will wait for all clock triggered times to reach before considering
the suite as stalled, even if the clock triggered tasks can never be
triggered due to dependencies issues.

With this change, the suite will treat waiting clock triggered tasks
with unsatisfied dependencies the same as other waiting tasks with
unsatisfied dependencies. However, it will consider a clock triggered
task as an *active* task if it has its dependencies satisfied but is
only waiting for the clock triggered time.

The change allows the stalled event to be raised as soon as the
following conditions are satisfied:
* There is no activity after one main loop.
* The task pool is left with only inactive tasks.
  * Active tasks are those that are not pending outputs of other tasks.
* The task pool has inactive tasks with unsatisfied dependencies.

Fix test UTC

This change pulls out a separate pollset_kick module, which currently
uses a freelist of pipes dynamically assigned to pollsets when they
enter polling rather than the previous racy sharding mechanism.

We ultimately may wish to eliminate the dynamic assignment for multipoll
sets, but this should be sufficient for the moment.

If we don't have a .o, we don't need dependencies, so skip the setup
step of building them. Instead, when building the .o, we generate the
.dep and output it (to objs/ to make the rules a little easier). The
next run of make will include the dep file and any dependencies will be
picked up.

This change also disables the disabling of dependency checking if we
have zlib or openssl being compiled from third_party. Additionally it
inverts the logic for including dependencies from ONLY if we are doing a
clean to ONLY if we are NOT doing a clean.

The implementation has two layers, ""specialized"" and ""fallback"". The

runtime detection of whether the specialized version works on this

1a277ecd93e908a47a905d323a4a1a77287cede1,grpc/grpc,"Remove libevent.

Fixed any exposed bugs across the stack.

Add a poll() based implementation. Heavily leverages pollset infrastructure to allow small polls to be the norm. Exposes a mechanism to plug in epoll/kqueue for platforms where we have them.

Simplify iomgr callbacks to return one bit of success or failure (instead of the multi valued result that was mostly unused previously). This will ease the burden on new implementations, and the previous system provided no real value anyway.

Removed timeouts on endpoint read/write routines. This simplifies porting burden by providing a more orthogonal interface, and the functionality can always be replicated when desired by using an alarm combined with endpoint_shutdown. I'm fairly certain we ended up with this interface because it was convenient to do from libevent.

Things that need attention still:
- adding an fd to a pollset is O(n^2) - but this is probably ok given that we'll not
use this for multipolling once platform specific implementations are added.
- we rely on the backup poller too often - especially for SSL handshakes and for client
connection establishment we should have a better mechanism ([] []
- Linux needs to use epoll for multiple fds, FreeBSD variants (including
Darwin) need to use kqueue. ([] []
- Linux needs to use eventfd for poll kicking. ([]

a7b028203499410a9f4bebe8220be8f3a9ce598b,0xAX/emacs,"Initial support for bidirectional editing.

 Makefile.in (obj): Include bidi.o.
 (bidi.o): New target.
 makefile.w32-in (OBJ1): Add $(BLD)/bidi.$(O).
 ($(BLD)/bidi.$(O)): New target.
 bidi.c: New file.
 buffer.h (struct buffer): New members bidi_display_reordering
 and bidi_paragraph_direction.
 buffer.c (init_buffer_once): Initialize bidi_display_reordering
 and bidi_paragraph_direction.
 (syms_of_buffer): Declare Lisp variables bidi-display-reordering
 and bidi-paragraph-direction.
 (Fbuffer_swap_text): Swap the values of
 bidi_display_reordering and bidi_paragraph_direction.
 dispextern.h (BIDI_MAXLEVEL, BIDI_AT_BASE_LEVEL): New macros.
 (bidi_type_t, bidi_dir_t): New types.
 (bidi_saved_info, bidi_stack, bidi_it): New structures.
 (struct it): New members bidi_p, bidi_it, paragraph_embedding,
 prev_stop, base_level_stop, and eol_pos.
 (bidi_init_it, bidi_get_next_char_visually): New prototypes.
 (IT_STACK_SIZE): Enlarge to 5.
 (struct glyph_row): New member reversed_p.
 <string_buffer_position>: Update prototype.
 (PRODUCE_GLYPHS): Set the reversed_p flag in the iterator's
 glyph_row if bidi_it.paragraph_dir == R2L.
 (struct glyph): New members resolved_level and bidi_type.
 dispnew.c (direct_output_forward_char): Give up if we need bidi
 processing or buffer's direction is right-to-left.
 (prepare_desired_row): Preserve the reversed_p flag.
 (row_equal_p): Compare the reversed_p attributes as well.
 xdisp.c (init_iterator): Initialize it->bidi_p.  Call
 bidi_init_it and set it->paragraph_embedding from the current
 buffer's value of bidi_paragraph_direction.
 (reseat_1): Initialize bidi_it.first_elt.
 (set_iterator_to_next, next_element_from_buffer): Use the value of
 paragraph_embedding to determine the paragraph direction.
 (set_iterator_to_next): Under bidi reordering, call
 bidi_get_next_char_visually.  Call bidi_paragraph_init if the
 new_paragraph flag is set in the bidi iterator.
 (next_element_from_buffer): If bidi_it.first_elt is set,
 initialize paragraph direction and find the first character to
 display in the visual order.  If reseated to a middle of a line,
 prime the bidi iterator starting at the line's beginning.  Handle
 the situation where we overstepped stop_charpos due to
 non-linearity of the bidi iteration.  Likewise for when we back up
 beyond the previous stop_charpos.  When moving across stop_charpos,
 record it in prev_stop.
 (display_line): Set row->end and it->start for the next row to the
 next character in logical order.  Always extend reversed_p rows to
 the end of line, even if they end at ZV.  Copy the reversed_p flag
 to the next glyph row.  Keep calling set_cursor_from_row for
 bidi-reordered rows even if we already have a possible candidate
 for cursor position.  Set row_end after all the row's glyphs have
 been produced, by looping over the glyphs.  Record the position
 after EOL in it->eol_pos, and use it to set end_pos of the last
 row produced for a continued line.
 <Qright_to_left, Qleft_to_right>: New variables.
 (syms_of_xdisp): Initialize and staticpro them.
 (string_buffer_position_lim): New function.
 (string_buffer_position): Most of code moved to
 string_buffer_position_lim.  Last argument and return value are
 now EMACS_INT; all callers changed.
 (set_cursor_from_row): Rewritten to support bidirectional text and
 reversed glyph rows.
 (text_outside_line_unchanged_p, try_window_id): Disable
 optimizations if we are reordering bidirectional text and the
 paragraph direction can be affected by the change.
 (append_glyph, append_composite_glyph)
 (produce_image_glyph, append_stretch_glyph): Set the
 resolved_level and bidi_type members of each glyph.
 (append_glyph): If the glyph row is reversed, prepend the glyph
 rather than appending it.
 (handle_stop_backwards): New function.
 (reseat_1, pop_it, push_it): Set prev_stop and base_level_stop.
 (reseat): call handle_stop_backwards to recompute prev_stop and
 base_level_stop for the new position.
 (handle_invisible_prop): Under bidi iteration, skip invisible text
 using bidi_get_next_char_visually.  If we are `reseat'ed, init the
 paragraph direction.  Update IT->prev_stop after skipping
 invisible text.
 (move_it_in_display_line_to): New variables prev_method
 and prev_pos.  Compare for strict equality in
 BUFFER_POS_REACHED_P.
 (try_cursor_movement): Examine all the candidate rows that occlude
 point, to return the best match.  If rows are bidi-reordered
 and point moved backwards, back up to the row that is not a
 continuation line, and start looking for a suitable row from
 there.
 term.c (append_glyph): Reverse glyphs by pre-pending them,
 rather than appending, if the glyph_row's reversed_p flag is set.
 Set the resolved_level and bidi_type members of each glyph.
 .gdbinit (pbiditype): New command.
 (pgx): Use it to display bidi level and type of the glyph.
 (pitx): Display some bidi information about the iterator.
 (prowlims, pmtxrows): New commands.
 files.el: Make bidi-display-reordering safe variable for boolean
 values.
 mule.texi (International): Mention support of bidirectional editing.
 (Bidirectional Editing): New section.
 HELLO: Reorder Arabic and Hebrew into logical order, and
 insert RLM before the opening paren, to make the display more
 reasonable.  Add setting for bidi-display-reordering in the local
 variables section.
 NEWS: Mention initial support for bidirectional editing.

fbb5531fa11d13854b274d28ccd329c9b6652cfc,0xAX/emacs,"More-conservative ‘format’ quote restyling

Instead of restyling curved quotes for every call to ‘format’,
create a new function ‘format-message’ that does the restyling,
and using the new function instead of ‘format’ only in contexts
where this seems appropriate.

This fixes a bug that has been present in Emacs since its creation.
It was reported by Chris Torek in 1983 even before GNU Emacs existed,
which must set some sort of record.  (Torek's bug report was against
a predecessor of GNU Emacs, but GNU Emacs happened to have the
same common flaw.)  See Torek's Usenet posting

b1573a97e17b518723ab3f906eb6d521caed196d,0xAX/emacs,"Use alignas to fix GCALIGN-related bugs

Use alignas and unions to specify alignments of objects needing
addresses that are at least a multiple of GCALIGNMENT.  Using
these standard C facilities should be safer than relying on ad hoc
and poorly-understood features like GCC’s __attribute__
((aligned (N))), the root cause for recent porting bugs like
Bug#29040.  The alignas macro was standardized by C11 and Gnulib
supports alignas for pre-C11 platforms.  I have tested this on Sun
Studio 12 sparc (2007) and GCC 4.4.7 x86-64 (2012) as well as on
more recent platforms like GCC 7.2.1 (2017) on Fedora 26 (both
x86-64 and x86).
* lib-src/make-docfile.c (close_emacs_globals): lispsym is now
just an array of struct Lisp_Symbol, since struct Lisp_Symbol is
now properly aligned.  All uses changed.
* src/alloc.c (NEXT_FREE_LISP_STRING): Just use the new u.next
member; this is simpler and safer than casting a pointer that
might not be aligned properly.
(aligned_Lisp_Symbol): Remove.  No longer needed, now that struct
Lisp_Symbol is aligned properly.  All uses replaced with struct
Lisp_Symbol.
* src/lisp.h (GCALIGNED): Remove, as it does not work as expected:
it can cause the natural alignment to be ignored.  All uses
replaced by unions with a ‘char alignas (GCALIGNMENT)’ member as
described below.
(struct Lisp_Symbol, struct Lisp_Cons, struct Lisp_String):
Change definition from ‘struct TAG { MEMBERS };’ to
‘struct TAG { union { struct { MEMBERS } s; char alignas
(GCALIGNMENT) gcaligned; } u; };’.  This guarantees ‘struct TAG’
to have an alignment that at least max (GCALIGNMENT, N) where N is
its old alignment.  All uses like ‘PTR->MEMBER’ changed to
‘PTR->u.s.MEMBER’; these uses were supposed to be mostly private
anyway.  Verify that the resulting ‘struct TAG’ is properly
aligned for Emacs.
(union vectorlike_header): New member ‘gcaligned’ to guarantee
that this type, and its containing types like ‘struct Lisp_Subr’,
‘struct buffer’ and ‘struct thread_state’, are all properly
aligned for Emacs.
(struct Lisp_String): New union member ‘next’, for the benefit
of NEXT_FREE_LISP_STRING.
(union Aligned_Cons, union Aligned_String): Remove.  All uses
replaced by struct Lisp_Cons and struct Lisp_String, since they
are now properly aligned.
(USE_STACK_CONS, USE_STACK_STRING): Simplify now that we can
assume struct Lisp_Cons and struct Lisp_String are properly
aligned.

2009-02-11  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

        Bug 571263 – make yielding functions dispatch results to mainloop

        * gobject/valaccodemethodmodule.vala:
        * valagasyncmodule.vala:

        Create simple async result from _async entry function and use it when
        doing return; throw; or at the end of the function.  Fix return 
        statements for the async case.  Dispatch via idle handler in the case
        that we are returning without having yielded.

Highlights:

* code_server no longer needs to call hipe_unified_loader:post_beam_load/1
  Instead new internal function hipe_redirect_to_module()
  is called by loading BIFs to patch native call sites if needed.

* hipe_purge_module() is called by erts_internal:purge_module/2
  to purge any native code.

* struct hipe_mfa_info redesigned and only used for exported
  functions that are called from or implemented by native code.
  A list of native call sites (struct hipe_ref) are kept for each hipe_mfa_info.

* struct hipe_sdesc used by hipe_find_mfa_from_ra()
  to build native stack traces.

Commit 22e7fc34c44c5ef95abf4fed429f2345410cc82c introduced a regression:
futexes were always disabled and the emulated codepath was always being
used.  That commit was in response to an originally buggy

properly).

When attempting to compile Swift 2 code (or any Swift code using the
Swift 2 names) in Swift 3, the compiler diagnostics are often entirely
useless because the names have changed radically enough that one
generally gets ""no member named 'foo'"" errors rather than a helpful
""'foo' was renamed to 'bar'"" error. This makes for a very poor user
experience when (e.g.) trying to move Swift 2 code forward to Swift 3.

To improve the experience, when the Swift 2 and Swift 3 names of an
API differ, the Clang importer will produce a ""stub"" declaration that
matches the Swift 2 API. That stub will be marked with a synthesized
attribute

  @available(unavailable, renamed: ""the-swift-3-name"")

that enables better diagnostics (e.g., ""'foo' is unavailable: renamed
to 'bar') along with Fix-Its (courtesy of @jrose-apple's recent work)
that fix the Swift 2 code to compile in Swift 3.

This change addresses much of rdar://problem/25309323 (concerning QoI
of Swift 2 code compiled with a Swift 3 compiler), but some cleanup
remains.

* the old behaviour optimized for typing Foo(<complete> instead of

* in editors with automatic brace-matching, we often conflicted with the
  editor, leading to extraneous closing parens

And in general, it is much more predictable for tooling to either insert
matching ( and ) or to not insert either.  While this change may not be
ideal For users of editors that do not do automatic brace-matching, I
believe it is still better overall to have to type a missing paren than
to have to delete an extraneous one.

The goal here is to make the short demangling as short and readable as possible, also at the cost of omitting some information.

da59d305c97680af0e1830179b700e524fd1d033,apple/swift,"Greatly improve type checker performance when inferring types for certain binary
expression applications

(rdar://problem/15933674, rdar://problem/17365394 and many, many dupes.)

When solving for the type of a binOp expression, factor the operand expression
types into account when collating overloads for the operator being applied.
This allows the type checker to now infer types for some binary operations with
hundreds of nested components, whereas previously we could only handle a handful.
(E.g., ""1+2+3+4+5+6"" previously sent the compiler into a tailspin.)

Specifically, if one of the operands is a literal, favor operator overloads
whose operand, result or contextual types are the default type of the literal
convertible conformance of the the argument literal type.

By doing so we can prevent exponential behavior in the solver and massively
reduce the complexity of many commonly found constraint systems. At the same
time, we'll still defer to ""better"" overloads if the default one cannot be
applied. (When adding an Int8 to an Int, for example.)

This obviously doesn't solve all of our performance problems (there are more
changes coming), but there are couple of nice side-effects:
- By tracking literal/convertible protocol conformance info within type
variables, I can potentially eliminate many instances of ""$T0"" and the
like from our diagnostics.
- Favored constraints are placed at the front of the overload resolution
disjunction, so if a system fails to produce a solution they'll be the
first to be mined for a cause. This helps preserve user intent, and leads
to better diagnostics being produced in some cases.

The goal of this series of commits is to allow the main module to consist
of both source files and AST files, where the AST files represent files
that were already built and don't need to be rebuilt, or of Swift source
files and imported Clang headers that share a module (because they are in
the same target).

Currently modules are divided into different kinds, and that defines how
decls are looked up, how imports are managed, etc. In order to achieve the
goal above, that polymorphism should be pushed down to the individual units
within a module, so that instead of TranslationUnit, BuiltinModule,
SerializedModule, and ClangModule, we have SourceFile, BuiltinUnit,
SerializedFile, and ClangUnit. (Better names welcome.) At that point we can
hopefully collapse TranslationUnit into Module and make Module non-polymorphic.

This commit makes SourceFile the subclass of an abstract FileUnit, and
makes TranslationUnit hold an array of FileUnits instead of SourceFiles.
To demonstrate that this is actually working, the Builtin module has also
been converted to FileUnit: it is now a TranslationUnit containing a single
BuiltinUnit.

In a previous commit, I banned in the verifier any SILValue from producing
ValueOwnershipKind::Any in preparation for this.

This change arises out of discussions in between John, Andy, and I around
ValueOwnershipKind::Trivial. The specific realization was that this ownership
kind was an unnecessary conflation of the a type system idea (triviality) with
an ownership idea (@any, an ownership kind that is compatible with any other
ownership kind at value merge points and can only create). This caused the
ownership model to have to contort to handle the non-payloaded or trivial cases
of non-trivial enums. This is unnecessary if we just eliminate the any case and
in the verifier separately verify that trivial => @any (notice that we do not
verify that @any => trivial).

NOTE: This is technically an NFC intended change since I am just replacing
Trivial with Any. That is why if you look at the tests you will see that I
actually did not need to update anything except removing some @trivial ownership
since @any ownership is represented without writing @any in the parsed sil.

bebfa969bdf1d67b8c9041f7fde216d09ca9bc0b,apple/swift,"Sema: Allow 'x.init' references on metatype expressions.

If 'x.init' appears as a member reference other than 'self.init' or 'super.init' within an initializer, treat it as a regular static member lookup for 'init' members. This allows a more explicit syntax for dynamic initializations; 'self.someMetatype()' looks too much like it's invoking a method. It also allows for partial applications of initializers using 'someMetatype.init' (though this needs some SILGen fixes, coming up next). While we're in the neighborhood, do some other correctness and QoI fixes:

- Only lookup initializers as members of metatypes, not instances, and add a fixit (instead of crashing) to insert '.dynamicType' if the initializer is found on an instance.
- Make it so that constructing a class-constrained archetype type correctly requires a 'required' or protocol initializer.
- Warn on unused initializer results. This seems to me like just the right thing to do, but is also a small guard against the fact that 'self.init' is now valid in a static method, but produces a newly-constructed value instead of delegating initialization (and evaluating to void).

This seems to more than fix a performance regression that we
detected on a metadata-allocation microbenchmark.

A few months ago, I improved the metadata cache representation
and changed the metadata allocation scheme to primarily use malloc.
Previously, we'd been using malloc in the concurrent tree data
structure but a per-cache slab allocator for the metadata itself.
At the time, I was concerned about the overhead of per-cache
allocators, since many metadata patterns see only a small number
of instantiations.  That's still an important factor, so in the
new scheme we're using a global allocator; but instead of using
malloc for individual allocations, we're using a slab allocator,
which should have better peak, single-thread performance, at the
cost of not easily supporting deallocation.  Deallocation is
only used for metadata when there's contention on the cache, and
specifically only when there's contention for the same key, so
leaking a little isn't the worst thing in the world.

The initial slab is a 64K globally-allocated buffer.
Successive slabs are 16K and allocated with malloc.

The overhead of uniquing the locations in a Densemap isn't worth any of

This is not too surpising as the ratio between SILInstructions and unique
SILLocations is not very high and the DenseMap also needs space.

98f4c832ae20e5b4dc37fee255fbaa8d13a43cde,ello/webapp,"Move all function binding up to the constructor

This should give us some pretty significant performance gains since we 
had a bunch of these living within or part of a sub method from render. 
By binding in the constructor we now are just creating the function and binding once rather than each time render is called.

We now fully conform to [react/jsx-no-bind](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-bind.md). We were scooting
around this rule because we are using the ES7 shorthand for binding — `::this.fn`.

To find these in the code base I did the following:

1. Searched for `{::this` and moved those out to the constructor
- Searched for `{\ ::this` and moved those out to the constructor
- Searched for `::this` which found a few others (mainly images and 
`loadDidSucceed` and `loadDidFail`)"

5f5029d2ac6348ecb07fc11f6656621c662ced92,scala/scala,"Optimizing TypeRef, starting with Symbols.

There are too many potential optimizations unavailable to us due to the
lack of bright lines among different kinds of symbols. For instance the
difference between a TypeSymbol which represents a type alias and one
which represents an abstract type is only whether the DEFERRED flag
is set. This creates issues.

1) There are many (many) places where tests are performed on every symbol
which could be done more efficiently and (especially) more verifiably
correctly with polymorphism.

2) TypeRefs based on those symbols are also checking that flag
constantly, in perpetuity. A symbol created as an alias is never (to the
best of my knowledge) going to intentionally morph into one representing
an abstract type, nor vice versa.

3) One has no guarantees, because anyone can set or reset the DEFERRED
flag at any time.

So tackling more than one problem at once herein:

1) I created canonical symbol creation points which take the flags as
an argument, so that there can be a difference between initializing a
symbol's flags and setting/resetting them at arbitrary times.

2) I structured all the symbol creators to take arguments in the
same order, which is:

  def newXXX(name: Name, ..., pos: Position = NoPosition, flags: Long = 0L)

(Where ""..."" is for those symbols which require something
beyond the name to create, such as a TypeSkolem's origin.)
The name is first because it's the only always required argument.
I left but deprecated the variations which take (pos, name).

3) I created subclasses of TypeRef based on the information which
should be stable from creation time onward:

  - args or no args?
  - abstract type, type alias, or class?

2x3 == 6 and that's how many subclasses of TypeRef there are now. So
now, for example, every TypeRef doesn't have to carry null symInfoCache
and thisInfoCache fields for the benefit of the minority which use them.
I still intend to realize the gain possible once we can evade the fields
for pre and args without losing pattern matcher efficiency.

This commit makes the ClassFileReader/ICodeReader parse class files
from JDK 7 (class file version 51). It does that by skipping over
the method handle related entries in the constant pool and by doing
some dummy processing on invoke dynamic instructions. The inliner
is updated to not try to inline a method with an invoke dynamic
instruction. A place holder INVOKE_DYNAMIC instruction is added to ICode
but it is designed to create an error if there's ever any attempt to
analyze it. Because the inliner is the only phase that ever tries
to analyze ICode instructions not generated from Scala source and
because Scala source will never emit an INVOKE_DYNAMIC, the place
holder INVOKE_DYNAMIC should never cause any errors.

A test is included that generates a class file with INVOKE_DYNAMIC
and then compiles Scala code that depends on it.

379384c887b01e6e8b48de671d4b2a99b6fdf520,scala/scala,"Unreachability analysis for pattern matches

Analyze matches for unreachable cases.

A case is unreachable if it implies its preceding cases.
Call `C` the formula that is satisfiable if the considered case matches.
Call `P` the formula that is satisfiable if the cases preceding it match.
The case is reachable if there is a model for `-P /\ C`.
Thus, the case is unreachable if there is no model for `-(-P /\ C)`,
or, equivalently, `P \/ -C`, or `C => P`.

Unreachability needs a more precise model for type and value tests than exhaustivity.
Before, `{case _: Int => case 1 =>}` would be modeled as `X = Int \/ X = 1.type`,
and thus, the second case would be reachable if we can satisfy `X != Int /\ X = 1.type`.
Of course, the case isn't reachable, yet the formula is satisfiable, so we must augment
our model to take into account that `X = 1.type => X = Int`.

This is done by `removeVarEq`, which models the following axioms about equality.
It does so to retain the meaning of equality after replacing `V = C` (variable = constant)
by a literal (fresh symbol). For each variable:
 1. a sealed type test must result in exactly one of its partitions being chosen
    (the core of exhaustivity)
 2. when a type test is true, tests of super types must also be true,
    and unrelated type tests must be false

For example, `V : X ::= A | B | C`, and `A => B` (since `A extends B`).
Coverage (1) is formulated as: `A \/ B \/ C`, and the implications of (2) are simply
`V=A => V=B /\ V=X`, `V=B => V=X`, `V=C => V=X`.

Exclusion for unrelated types typically results from matches such as `{case SomeConst =>
case OtherConst => }`. Here, `V=SomeConst.type => !V=OtherConst.type`. This is a
conservative approximation. If these constants happen to be the same value dynamically
(but the types don't tell us this), the last case is actually unreachable. Of course we
must err on the safe side.

We simplify the equality axioms as follows (in principle this could be done by the
solver, but it's easy to do before solving). If we've already excluded a pair of
assignments of constants to a certain variable at some point, say `(-A \/ -B)`, then
don't exclude the symmetric one `(-B \/ -A)`. (Nor the positive implications `-B \/ A`,
or `-A \/ B`, which would entail the equality axioms falsifying the whole formula.)

TODO: We should also model dependencies between variables: if `V1` corresponds to
`x: List[_]` and `V2` is `x.hd`, `V2` cannot be assigned at all when `V1 = null` or
`V1 = Nil`. Right now this is implemented hackily by pruning counter-examples in exhaustivity.
Unreachability would also benefit from a more faithful representation.

I had to refactor some of the framework, but most of it is shared with exhaustivity. We
must allow approximating tree makers twice, sharing variables, but using different
approximations for values not statically known. When considering reachability of a case,
we must assume, for example, that its unknown guard succeeds (otherwise it would wrongly
be considered unreachable), whereas unknown guards in the preceding cases must be
considered to fail (otherwise we could never get to those case, and again, it would
falsely be considered unreachable).

Since this analysis is relatively expensive, you may opt-out using `-Xno-patmat-analysis`
(or annotating the selector with @unchecked). We hope to improve the performance in the
near future. -Ystatistics has also been extended to provide some numbers on time spent in
the equality-rewrite, solving and analyzing.

9812c7d3c9dc10ed2e96499c755657ca5bd90ddb,scala/scala,"Add bridges for overridden methods in lambda indy call

If a SAM trait's abstract method overrides a method in a
supertrait while changing the return type, the generated
invokedynamic instruction needs to pass the types of the
overridden methods to `LambdaMetaFactory` so that bridge
methods can be added to the generated lambda.

SAM `Function` trees now have a synthetic `ClassSymbol`,
into which we enter an overriding concrete method symbol
that represents the runtime LMF-generated implementation
of that function. `erasure` then computes bridge methods
for that class, which are added to the `LMF.metafactory`
call in `jvm`.

Java does this instead by generating a default method in
the subinterface overriding the superinterface's method.
Theoretically, we could generate the bridges in the same
way, but that has the downside that the project with the
interfaces would need recompiled, which might not be the
project that creates the lambdas. Generating bridges the
LMF way means that only the classes affected by this bug
need to be recompiled to get the fix.

Honestly I'm surprised that this hasn't come up already.

Fixes scala/bug#10512.

1aa97cb81b96cbf1e7b7b2cd42dd5bd3d8e5c6dd,scala/scala,"Make lambda body public rather than using static accessor

Under -Ydelambdafy:method (the basis of the upcoming ""indylambda""
translation for -target:jvm-1.8), an anonymous function is currently
encoded as:

 1. a private method containing the lambda's code
 2. a public, static accessor method that allows access to 1 from
    other classes, namely:
 3. an anonymous class capturing free variables and implementing
    the suitable FunctionN interface.

In our prototypes of indylambda, we do away with 3, instead deferring
creating of this class to JDK8's LambdaMetafactory by way of an
invokedynamic instruction at the point of lambda capture. This
facility can use a private method as the lambda target; access is
mediated by the runtime-provided instance of
`java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup` that confers the privelages
of the lambda capture call site to the generated implementation class.
Indeed, The java compiler uses this to emit private lambda body
methods.

However, there are two Scala specific factors that make this
a little troublesome.

First, Scala's optimizer may want to inline the lambda capture
call site into a new enclosing class. In general, this isn't a
safe optimization, as `invokedynamic` instructions have call-site
specific semantics. But we will rely the ability to inline like
this in order to eliminate closures altogether where possible.

Second, to support lambda deserialization, the Java compiler creates
a synthetic method `$dersializeLamda$` in each class that captures
them, just to be able to get the suitable access to spin up an
anoymous class with access to the private method. It only needs
to do this for functional interfaces that extends Serializable,
which is the exception rather than the rule. But in Scala, *every*
function must support serialization, so blindly copying the Java
approach will lead to some code bloat.

I have prototyped a hybrid approach to these challenges: use the
private method directly where it is allowed, but fall back to
using the accessor method in a generic lambda deserializer or
in call sites that have been inlined into a new enclosing class.

However, the most straight forward approach is to simply emit the
lambda bodies as public (with an mangled name and with the SYHTNETIC
flag) and use them in all cases. That is what is done in this commit.

This does moves us one step backwards from the goals of SI-7085,
but it doesn't seem sensible to incur the inconvenience from locking
down one small part of our house when we don't have a plan or the
budget to complete that job.

The REPL has some fancy logic to decompile the bodys of lambdas
(`:javap -fun C#m`) which needed tweaking to accomodate this change.
I haven't tried to make this backwards compatible with the old
encoding as `-Ydelambdafy:method` is still experimental.

2ca7d4ff90fedcd2dba654100bd8d6ce1f1ad36b,scala/scala,"Symbols making friends with Polly Morphism.

Since I have established (no small effort, this) that there is no need
for certain important flags to be mutable for the entire lifetime of a
symbol, I have codified this knowledge by moving it out of the flags
entirely and into the inheritance hierarchy where its constant nature
can find true happiness.

     AliasTypeSymbol ... it's an alias (forever!)
  AbstractTypeSymbol ... it's an abstract type (forever!)

The only time DEFERRED is inspected is if the generic creation function
is called (e.g. ""newTypeSymbol"", not ""newAliasType"") in which case the
presence of the flag is used to determine which symbol to create. This
is mostly for legacy support.

Certain symbols were being created inconsistently with the others. Now
every symbol is created by invoking a creation method on the owner, with
the exception of FreeVar. I changed the owner of those from RootClass
to NoSymbol because there is no reason for them to pollute the symbol
hierarchy at the root.

The signature of cloneSymbolImpl is now

  def cloneSymbolImpl(owner: Symbol, newFlags: Long): Symbol

There is an overload with the old signature which calls that one with no
flags. With this step, every symbol creation in trunk is performed with
knowledge of the initial flags, opening the door to many optimizations
in the Symbol and Type logic, not to mention boosting my sanity by at
least five sanity points.

682fec0ef8361bdb93de3bfe3c1f3712cc15b36f,scala/scala,"Implementation of byname implicits with recursive dictionaries

This is an implementation of byname implicit parameters with recursive
dictionaries, intended as a language-level replacement for shapeless's
Lazy type. As of this commit, implicit arguments can be marked as byname
and at call sites recursive uses of implicit values are permitted if
they occur in an implicit byname argument.

Consider the following example,

  trait Foo { def next: Foo }
  object Foo {
    implicit def foo(implicit rec: Foo): Foo =
      new Foo { def next = rec }
  }
  val foo = implicitly[Foo]
  assert(foo eq foo.next)

In current Scala this would diverge due to the recursive implicit
argument rec of method foo. Under the scheme implemented in this commit
we can mark the recursive implicit parameter as byname,

  trait Foo { def next: Foo }
  object Foo {
    implicit def foo(implicit rec: => Foo): Foo =
      new Foo { def next = rec }
  }
  val foo = implicitly[Foo]
  assert(foo eq foo.next)

and recursive occurrences of this sort are extracted out as val members
of a local synthetic object as follows,

  val foo: Foo = scala.Predef.implicitly[Foo](
    {
      object LazyDefns$1 {
        val rec$1: Foo = Foo.foo(rec$1)
                         //      ^^^^^
                         // recursive knot tied here
      }
      LazyDefns$1.rec$1
    }
  )
  assert(foo eq foo.next)

and the example compiles with the assertion successful. Note that the
recursive use of rec$1 occurs within the byname argument of foo and is
consequently deferred. The desugaring matches what a programmer would do
to construct such a recursive value explicitly.

This general pattern is essential to the derivation of type class
instances for recursive data types, one of shapeless's most common
applications.

Byname implicits have a number of benefits over the macro implementation
of Lazy in shapeless,

+ the implementation of Lazy in shapeless is extremely delicate, relying
  on non-portable compiler internals. By contrast there is already an
  initial implementation of byname implicits in Dotty:
  https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/1998.
+ the shapeless implementation is unable to modify divergence checking,
  so to solve recursive instances it effectively disables divergence
  checking altogether ... this means that incautious use of Lazy can cause
  the typechecker to loop indefinitely. The byname implicits
  implementation is able to both solve recursive occurrences and check for
  divergence.
+ the implementation of Lazy interferes with the heuristics for solving
  inductive implicits in #6481 because the latter depends on being able to
  verify that induction steps strictly reduce the size of the types being
  solved for; the additional Lazy type constructors make the type appear
  be non-decreasing in size. Whilst this could be special-cased, doing so
  would require some knowledge of shapeless to be incorporated into the
  compiler. Being a language-level feature, byname implicits can be
  accommodated directly in the induction heuristics.
+ in common cases more implicit arguments would have to be marked as
  Lazy than would have to be marked as byname under this PR due to
  restrictions on what the Lazy macro is able to do. Given that there is a
  runtime cost associated with capturing the thunks required for both Lazy
  and byname arguments, any reduction in the number is beneficial.

Inline the forwarders from CompilationUnit, which should not affect behavior.
Since all forwarders lead to global.reporter, don't first navigate
to a compilation unit, only to then forward back to global.reporter.

The cleanup in the previous commits revealed a ton of confusion
regarding how to report an error.

This was a mechanical search/replace, which has low potential for messing
things up, since the list of available methods are disjoint between
`reporter` and `currentRun.reporting`. The changes involving `typer.context`
were done previously.

Essentially, there are three ways to report:
  - via typer.context, so that reporting can be silenced (buffered)
  - via global.currentRun.reporting, which summarizes (e.g., deprecation)
  - via global.reporter, which is (mostly) stateless and straightforward.

Ideally, these should all just go through `global.currentRun.reporting`,
with the typing context changing that reporter to buffer where necessary.

After the refactor, these are the ways in which we report (outside of typer):
  - reporter.comment
  - reporter.echo
  - reporter.error
  - reporter.warning
  - currentRun.reporting.deprecationWarning
  - currentRun.reporting.incompleteHandled
  - currentRun.reporting.incompleteInputError
  - currentRun.reporting.inlinerWarning
  - currentRun.reporting.uncheckedWarning

Before:
  - c.cunit.error
  - c.enclosingUnit.deprecationWarning
  - context.unit.error
  - context.unit.warning
  - csymCompUnit.warning
  - cunit.error
  - cunit.warning
  - currentClass.cunit.warning
  - currentIClazz.cunit.inlinerWarning
  - currentRun.currentUnit.error
  - currentRun.reporting
  - currentUnit.deprecationWarning
  - currentUnit.error
  - currentUnit.warning
  - getContext.unit.warning
  - getCurrentCUnit.error
  - global.currentUnit.uncheckedWarning
  - global.currentUnit.warning
  - global.reporter
  - icls.cunit.warning
  - item.cunit.warning
  - reporter.comment
  - reporter.echo
  - reporter.error
  - reporter.warning
  - reporting.deprecationWarning
  - reporting.incompleteHandled
  - reporting.incompleteInputError
  - reporting.inlinerWarning
  - reporting.uncheckedWarning
  - typer.context.unit.warning
  - unit.deprecationWarning
  - unit.echo
  - unit.error
  - unit.incompleteHandled
  - unit.incompleteInputError
  - unit.uncheckedWarning
  - unit.warning
  - v1.cunit.warning

All these methods ended up calling a method on `global.reporter`
or on `global.currentRun.reporting` (their interfaces are disjoint).

Also clean up `TypeDiagnostics`: inline nearly-single-use private methods.

Conceptually, the fix would be `def selfTypeSkolemized =

Original patch by @retronym in #1074, refined by @paulp to
only perform widen.narrow incantation if there are
existentials present in the widened type, as
narrowing is expensive when the type is not a singleton.

The result is that compiling the entirety of quick, that
code path is hit only 143 times.  All the other calls hit
.narrow directly as before.  It looks like the definition
of negligible in the diff of -Ystatistics when compiling

This commit removes the flash on unstyled content while in dev
mode that was caused by the use of style-loader. Instead it
enables mini-css-extract-plugin in dev in combination with
css-hot-loader which enables HMR for development.

This is because mini-css-extract-plugin does not currently support
HMR out of the box. It also adds a SourceMapDevtoolPlugin to enable
sourcemaps with css since mini-css breaks sourcemaps when used in
combination with the cheap-module-evel-source-map setting.

dd0c50f0df26a9c204088e13ce0cfd6e726f6586,zulip/zulip,"Extract compose_actions.js.

This module extracts these two functions that get called by
several other modules:

    start()
    cancel()

It is a little bit arbitrary which functions got pulled over
with them, but it's generally functions that would have only
been called via start/cancel.

There are two goals for splitting out this code.  The first
goal is simply to make `compose.js` have fewer responsibilities.
The second goal is to help break up circular dependencies.
The extraction of this module does more to clarify
dependencies than actually break them.  The methods start()
and cancel() had actually been shimmed in an earlier commit,
and now they no longer have a shim.

Besides start/cancel, most of the functions here are only
exported to facilitate test stubbing.  An exception is
decorate_stream_bar(), which is currently called from
ui_init.js.  We probably should move the ""blur"" handler out
of there, but cleaning up ui_init.js is a project for another
day.

It may seem slightly odd that this commit doesn't pull over
finish() into this module, but finish() would bring in the
whole send-message codepath.  You can think of it like this:

* compose_actions basically just populates the compose box
* compose.finish() makes the compose box do its real job,
  which is to send a message

The pointer to the user parameter of the callback registration is
automatically pass to the callback function.
There is no point to allow changing this user parameter by a caller.
That's why this parameter is always set to NULL by PMDs and set only
in ethdev layer before calling the callback function.

The history is that the user parameter was initially used
by the callback implementation to pass some information
between the application and the driver:
	c1ceaf3ad056 (""ethdev: add an argument to internal callback function"")
Then a new parameter has been added to leave the user parameter
to its standard usage of context given at registration:
	d6af1a13d7a1 (""ethdev: add return values to callback process API"")

The NULL parameter in the internal callback processing function
is now removed. It makes clear that the callback parameter is user
managed and opaque from a DPDK point of view.

aec9c13c5257f0dae350152fa0444634fe35859e,anlaneg/dpdk,"eal: add function to release internal resources

This commit adds a new function rte_eal_cleanup().
The function serves as a hook to allow DPDK to release
internal resources (e.g.: hugepage allocations).

This function allows DPDK to become more like an ordinary
library, where the library context itself can be initialized
and cleaned up by the application.

The rte_exit() and rte_panic() functions must be considered,
particularly if they should call rte_eal_cleanup() to release any
resources or not. This patch adds the cleanup to rte_exit(),
but does not clean up on rte_panic(). The reason to not clean
up on panicing is that the developer may wish to inspect the
exact internal state of EAL and hugepages.

(This PR addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16980.)

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

In a new Spark session, when a partitioned Hive table is converted to use Spark's `HadoopFsRelation` in `HiveMetastoreCatalog`, metadata for every partition of that table are retrieved from the metastore and loaded into driver memory. In addition, every partition's metadata files are read from the filesystem to perform schema inference.

If a user queries such a table with predicates which prune that table's partitions, we would like to be able to answer that query without consulting partition metadata which are not involved in the query. When querying a table with a large number of partitions for some data from a small number of partitions (maybe even a single partition), the current conversion strategy is highly inefficient. I suspect this scenario is not uncommon in the wild.

In addition to being inefficient in running time, the current strategy is inefficient in its use of driver memory. When the sum of the number of partitions of all tables loaded in a driver reaches a certain level (somewhere in the tens of thousands), their cached data exhaust all driver heap memory in the default configuration. I suspect this scenario is less common (in that not too many deployments work with tables with tens of thousands of partitions), however this does illustrate how large the memory footprint of this metadata can be. With tables with hundreds or thousands of partitions, I would expect the `HiveMetastoreCatalog` table cache to represent a significant portion of the driver's heap space.

This PR proposes an alternative approach. Basically, it makes four changes:

1. It adds a new method, `listPartitionsByFilter` to the Catalyst `ExternalCatalog` trait which returns the partition metadata for a given sequence of partition pruning predicates.
1. It refactors the `FileCatalog` type hierarchy to include a new `TableFileCatalog` to efficiently return files only for partitions matching a sequence of partition pruning predicates.
1. It removes partition loading and caching from `HiveMetastoreCatalog`.
1. It adds a new Catalyst optimizer rule, `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, which applies a plan's partition-pruning predicates to prune out unnecessary partition files from a `HadoopFsRelation`'s underlying file catalog.

The net effect is that when a query over a partitioned Hive table is planned, the analyzer retrieves the table metadata from `HiveMetastoreCatalog`. As part of this operation, the `HiveMetastoreCatalog` builds a `HadoopFsRelation` with a `TableFileCatalog`. It does not load any partition metadata or scan any files. The optimizer prunes-away unnecessary table partitions by sending the partition-pruning predicates to the relation's `TableFileCatalog `. The `TableFileCatalog` in turn calls the `listPartitionsByFilter` method on its external catalog. This queries the Hive metastore, passing along those filters.

As a bonus, performing partition pruning during optimization leads to a more accurate relation size estimate. This, along with c481bdf, can lead to automatic, safe application of the broadcast optimization in a join where it might previously have been omitted.

## Open Issues

1. This PR omits partition metadata caching. I can add this once the overall strategy for the cold path is established, perhaps in a future PR.
1. This PR removes and omits partitioned Hive table schema reconciliation. As a result, it fails to find Parquet schema columns with upper case letters because of the Hive metastore's case-insensitivity. This issue may be fixed by #14750, but that PR appears to have stalled. ericl has contributed to this PR a workaround for Parquet wherein schema reconciliation occurs at query execution time instead of planning. Whether ORC requires a similar patch is an open issue.
1. This PR omits an implementation of `listPartitionsByFilter` for the `InMemoryCatalog`.
1. This PR breaks parquet log output redirection during query execution. I can work around this by running `Class.forName(""org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$"")` first thing in a Spark shell session, but I haven't figured out how to fix this properly.

## How was this patch tested?

The current Spark unit tests were run, and some ad-hoc tests were performed to validate that only the necessary partition metadata is loaded.

When we append data to a partitioned table with `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`, there are 2 issues:

This PR fixes them by moving the special partition handling code from `DataSourceAnalysis` to `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`, so that the `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` code path can also benefit from it.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

When profiling heap dumps from the HistoryServer and live Spark web UIs, I found a large amount of memory being wasted on duplicated objects and strings. This patch's changes remove most of this duplication, resulting in over 40% memory savings for some benchmarks.

- **Task metrics** (6441f0624dfcda9c7193a64bfb416a145b5aabdf): previously, every `TaskUIData` object would have its own instances of `InputMetricsUIData`, `OutputMetricsUIData`, `ShuffleReadMetrics`, and `ShuffleWriteMetrics`, but for many tasks these metrics are irrelevant because they're all zero. This patch changes how we construct these metrics in order to re-use a single immutable ""empty"" value for the cases where these metrics are empty.
- **TaskInfo.accumulables** (ade86db901127bf13c0e0bdc3f09c933a093bb76): Previously, every `TaskInfo` object had its own empty `ListBuffer` for holding updates from named accumulators. Tasks which didn't use named accumulators still paid for the cost of allocating and storing this empty buffer. To avoid this overhead, I changed the `val` with a mutable buffer into a `var` which holds an immutable Scala list, allowing tasks which do not have named accumulator updates to share the same singleton `Nil` object.
- **String.intern() in JSONProtocol** (7e05630e9a78c455db8c8c499f0590c864624e05): in the HistoryServer, executor hostnames and ids are deserialized from JSON, leading to massive duplication of these string objects. By calling `String.intern()` on the deserialized values we can remove all of this duplication. Since Spark now requires Java 7+ we don't have to worry about string interning exhausting the permgen (see http://java-performance.info/string-intern-in-java-6-7-8/).

## How was this patch tested?

I ran

```
sc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).count()
```

in `spark-shell` with event logging enabled, then loaded that event log in the HistoryServer, performed a full GC, and took a heap dump. According to YourKit, the changes in this patch reduced memory consumption by roughly 28 megabytes (or 770k Java objects):

Here's a table illustrating the drop in objects due to deduplication (the drop is <100k for some objects because some events were dropped from the listener bus; this is a separate, existing bug that I'll address separately after CPU-profiling):

Some analysis rules generate aliases or auxiliary attribute references with the same name but different expression IDs. For example, `ResolveAggregateFunctions` introduces `havingCondition` and `aggOrder`, and `DistinctAggregationRewriter` introduces `gid`.

This is OK for normal query execution since these attribute references get expression IDs. However, it's troublesome when converting resolved query plans back to SQL query strings since expression IDs are erased.

Here's an example Spark 1.6.0 snippet for illustration:
```scala
sqlContext.range(10).select('id as 'a, 'id as 'b).registerTempTable(""t"")
sqlContext.sql(""SELECT SUM(a) FROM t GROUP BY a, b ORDER BY COUNT(a), COUNT(b)"").explain(true)
```
The above code produces the following resolved plan:
```
== Analyzed Logical Plan ==
_c0: bigint
Project [_c0#101L]
+- Sort [aggOrder#102L ASC,aggOrder#103L ASC], true
   +- Aggregate [a#47L,b#48L], [(sum(a#47L),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS _c0#101L,(count(a#47L),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS aggOrder#102L,(count(b#48L),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS aggOrder#103L]
      +- Subquery t
         +- Project [id#46L AS a#47L,id#46L AS b#48L]
            +- LogicalRDD [id#46L], MapPartitionsRDD[44] at range at <console>:26
```
Here we can see that both aggregate expressions in `ORDER BY` are extracted into an `Aggregate` operator, and both of them are named `aggOrder` with different expression IDs.

The solution is to automatically add the expression IDs into the attribute name for the Alias and AttributeReferences that are generated by Analyzer in SQL Generation.

In this PR, it also resolves another issue. Users could use the same name as the internally generated names. The duplicate names should not cause name ambiguity. When resolving the column, Catalyst should not pick the column that is internally generated.

Could you review the solution? marmbrus liancheng

I did not set the newly added flag for all the alias and attribute reference generated by Analyzers. Please let me know if I should do it? Thank you!

If the intended behavior was that uncaught exceptions thrown in functions being run by the Akka scheduler would end up being handled by the default uncaught exception handler set in Executor, and if that behavior is, in fact, correct, then this is a way to accomplish that.  I'm not certain, though, that we shouldn't be doing something different to handle uncaught exceptions from some of these scheduled functions.

In any event, this PR covers all of the cases I comment on in [SPARK-1620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1620).

This PR generates code that get a value in each column from ```ColumnVector``` instead of creating ```InternalRow``` when ```ColumnarBatch``` is accessed. This PR improves benchmark program by up to 15%.
This PR consists of two parts:

1. Get an ```ColumnVector ``` by using ```ColumnarBatch.column()``` method
2. Get a value of each column by using ```rdd_col${COLIDX}.getInt(ROWIDX)``` instead of ```rdd_row.getInt(COLIDX)```

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

PySpark Param constructors need to pass the TypeConverter argument by name, partly to make sure it is not mistaken for the expectedType arg and partly because we will remove the expectedType arg in 2.1. In several places, this is not being done correctly.

This PR changes all usages in pyspark/ml/ to keyword args.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing unit tests.  I will not test type conversion for every Param unless we really think it necessary.

Also, if you start the PySpark shell and import classes (e.g., pyspark.ml.feature.StandardScaler), then you no longer get this warning:
```
/Users/josephkb/spark/python/pyspark/ml/param/__init__.py:58: UserWarning: expectedType is deprecated and will be removed in 2.1. Use typeConverter instead, as a keyword argument.
  ""Use typeConverter instead, as a keyword argument."")
```
That warning came from the typeConverter argument being passes as the expectedType arg by mistake.

This pull request adds a Scalastyle regex rule which fails the style check if `Class.forName` is used directly.  `Class.forName` always loads classes from the default / system classloader, but in a majority of cases, we should be using Spark's own `Utils.classForName` instead, which tries to load classes from the current thread's context classloader and falls back to the classloader which loaded Spark when the context classloader is not defined.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

PR #11443 temporarily disabled MiMA check, this PR re-enables it.

One extra change is that `object DataFrame` is also removed. The only purpose of introducing `object DataFrame` was to use it as an internal factory for creating `Dataset[Row]`. By replacing this internal factory with `Dataset.newDataFrame`, both `DataFrame` and `DataFrame$` are entirely removed from the API, so that we can simply put a `MissingClassProblem` filter in `MimaExcludes.scala` for most DataFrame API  changes.

363baacaded56047bcc63276d729ab911e0336cf,apache/spark,"SPARK-3811 [CORE] More robust / standard Utils.deleteRecursively, Utils.createTempDir

I noticed a few issues with how temp directories are created and deleted:

*Minor*

* Guava's `Files.createTempDir()` plus `File.deleteOnExit()` is used in many tests to make a temp dir, but `Utils.createTempDir()` seems to be the standard Spark mechanism
* Call to `File.deleteOnExit()` could be pushed into `Utils.createTempDir()` as well, along with this replacement
* _I messed up the message in an exception in `Utils` in SPARK-3794; fixed here_

*Bit Less Minor*

* `Utils.deleteRecursively()` fails immediately if any `IOException` occurs, instead of trying to delete any remaining files and subdirectories. I've observed this leave temp dirs around. I suggest changing it to continue in the face of an exception and throw one of the possibly several exceptions that occur at the end.
* `Utils.createTempDir()` will add a JVM shutdown hook every time the method is called. Even if the subdir is the parent of another parent dir, since this check is inside the hook. However `Utils` manages a set of all dirs to delete on shutdown already, called `shutdownDeletePaths`. A single hook can be registered to delete all of these on exit. This is how Tachyon temp paths are cleaned up in `TachyonBlockManager`.

I noticed a few other things that might be changed but wanted to ask first:

* Shouldn't the set of dirs to delete be `File`, not just `String` paths?
* `Utils` manages the set of `TachyonFile` that have been registered for deletion, but the shutdown hook is managed in `TachyonBlockManager`. Should this logic not live together, and not in `Utils`? it's more specific to Tachyon, and looks a slight bit odd to import in such a generic place.

JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2053

This PR adds support for two types of CASE statements present in Hive. The first type is of the form `CASE WHEN a THEN b [WHEN c THEN d]* [ELSE e] END`, with the semantics like a chain of if statements. The second type is of the form `CASE a WHEN b THEN c [WHEN d THEN e]* [ELSE f] END`, with the semantics like a switch statement on key `a`. Both forms are implemented in `CaseWhen`.

[This link](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF#LanguageManualUDF-ConditionalFunctions) contains more detailed descriptions on their semantics.

Notes / Open issues:

* Please check if any implicit contracts / invariants are broken in the implementations (especially for the operators). I am not very familiar with them and I currently find them tricky to spot.
* We should decide whether or not a non-boolean condition is allowed in a branch of `CaseWhen`. Hive throws a `SemanticException` for this situation and I think it'd be good to mimic it -- the question is where in the whole Spark SQL pipeline should we signal an exception for such a query.

This change modifies the ""assembly/"" module to just copy needed
dependencies to its build directory, and modifies the packaging
script to pick those up (and remove duplicate jars packages in the
examples module).

I also made some minor adjustments to dependencies to remove some
test jars from the final packaging, and remove jars that conflict with each
other when packaged separately (e.g. servlet api).

Also note that this change restores guava in applications' classpaths, even
though it's still shaded inside Spark. This is now needed for the Hadoop
libraries that are packaged with Spark, which now are not processed by
the shade plugin.

- arrays: array=({a,b} other)

So I inserted BraceDetectAll in osh/cmd_parse.py and osh/word_parse.py;
and BraceExpandAll in core/word_eval.py and core/cmd_exec.py.

I also fixed tilde expansion in all three contexts and added tests.

Changes to the algorithm in braces.py:

- Fixed bug where alternatives like {a,b}{c,d} were expanded in the
  wrong order.  The first one varies the slowest, and the last the
  fastest: ac ad bc bd.
- Fix error cases like {foo}
- Use _StackFrame to simplify the code

Testing:

- Add a comparison of count.sh to gold-test.sh, so we're testing the
  brace expansion in our own repo.
- Add date and oil version information to spec tests.

Other:

- Fixed a typo in evaluation of EscapedLiteralPart, which fixed a bunch
  of tests.  (--osh-allowed-failures bumped down in several places.)
- Rename AltPart to BracedAltPart, NumRangePart to BracedNumRangePart.

When we have multiple systems trying to start concurrent jobs on different
CPUs, they typically pick the first available (operating) CPU to schedule
the job on. This works fine when there's only one set of jobs or when we
want to bind jobs to specific CPUs.

When we have jobs such as asynchronously loading LIDs and scanning PHBs,
we don't care which CPUs they run on, we care more that they are not
scheduled on CPUs that have existing tasks.

This patch adds a global queue of jobs which secondary CPUs will look
at for work (if idle).

This leads to simplified callers, which just need to queue jobs to NULL
(no specific CPU) and then call a magic function that will run the
CPU job queue if we don't have secondary CPUs.

Additionally, we add a const char *name to cpu_job just to aid with
debugging.

b4c912484c9724f2f3601b55d992c46a7dc3c5fd,zerothi/sisl,"enh: added supercell wavefunctions, large speedup in psi calculation

Enabled supercell wavefunction calculations. Also enabled k-point wavefunctions.

Many of the loops for the psi calculation could be moved to outside and will thus
be much faster for systems with atoms with many orbitals. I.e. now the indices
are gathered per atom (for the maxium R), and then subsequently calculated for
all orbitals on this atom, finally adding it to the grid.

A bug fix for skewed lattices has been corrected, the R-vector dependent on the indices
did not take off-diagonal cell elements into account.

The loop is now over all supercell atoms which makes it extremely slow for large systems,
however, we quickly skip the atoms that does not have points in the region of the grid
which should be rather quick.

Cleaned up Orbital classes and added a psi_rtp call which accepts spherical coordinates.
This is particularly important for performance in the Grid class because we can
calculate the spherical coordinates per-atom, and then reuse them per-orbital.

A possible bug has been corrected by removing all mentions of origo in calculations.
This is not too thought out. Would the user expect origo to be intrinsic in the coordinates
and operations, or are they merely used for finalization.
Currently the origo is mainly usable for the Grids where one can concentrate the grid
by selecting an appropriate origo.

Bug-fix for the Grid.index function to resemble that of Siesta.

TODO check whether my min_max function actually works. I think we are skipping some elements
in the psi calculation. I need to check (equation of circle to min/max of indices).

a0fd91cefcc054b770dec6d8fb60db0d3145c45a,Broadcom/dpdk,"mempool: rename functions with confusing names

The mempool_count and mempool_free_count behaved contrary to what their
names suggested. The free_count function actually returned the number of
elements that were allocated from the pool, not the number unallocated as
the name implied.

Fix this by introducing two new functions to replace the old ones,
* rte_mempool_avail_count to replace rte_mempool_count
* rte_mempool_in_use_count to replace rte_mempool_free_count

In this patch, the new functions are added, and the old ones are marked
as deprecated. All apps and examples that use the old functions are
updated to use the new functions.

e996506a1c07f145aa15ea6756cb11f2c705d1d3,Broadcom/dpdk,"lib/gro: add Generic Receive Offload API framework

Generic Receive Offload (GRO) is a widely used SW-based offloading
technique to reduce per-packet processing overhead. It gains
performance by reassembling small packets into large ones. This
patchset is to support GRO in DPDK. To support GRO, this patch
implements a GRO API framework.

To enable more flexibility to applications, DPDK GRO is implemented as
a user library. Applications explicitly use the GRO library to merge
small packets into large ones. DPDK GRO provides two reassembly modes.
One is called lightweight mode, the other is called heavyweight mode.
If applications want to merge packets in a simple way and the number
of packets is relatively small, they can use the lightweight mode.
If applications need more fine-grained controls, they can choose the
heavyweight mode.

rte_gro_reassemble_burst is the main reassembly API which is used in
lightweight mode and processes N packets at a time. For applications,
performing GRO in lightweight mode is simple. They just need to invoke
rte_gro_reassemble_burst. Applications can get GROed packets as soon as
rte_gro_reassemble_burst returns.

rte_gro_reassemble is the main reassembly API which is used in
heavyweight mode and tries to merge N inputted packets with the packets
in GRO reassembly tables. For applications, performing GRO in heavyweight
mode is relatively complicated. Before performing GRO, applications need
to create a GRO context object, which keeps reassembly tables of
desired GRO types, by rte_gro_ctx_create. Then applications can use
rte_gro_reassemble to merge packets. The GROed packets are in the
reassembly tables of the GRO context object. If applications want to get
them, applications need to manually flush them by flush API.

  Symbian port: Fixed environment initialization of the SampleBrowser. Seems that the ""main"" function needs to be under a ""TRAP"" statement - else all file read operations crash the program with a ""Main Panic E32USER-CBase 66"" error.
  The solution to the problem involved creating a new main function that initialize the environment and from inside it call the original main function (now called mainWithTrap) with a TRAP statment.

The main change is to use smaller sizes for smaller integer types instead of always using a long.

For decimals instead of using a string prefix with scale and precision in bytes. Right now this is always 12 and 16, but in the future it serialization could trim to the smallest necessary scale and precision and other scales and precisions can be supported.

The prefixes are large enough to exceed the supported representions of postgres and mysql, and postgres's is quite large.

Various locations sizing thread pools based on processor count could result in pool size 0. Others sized pools too large based on Andy's recent measurements. Pools that need parallelism but shouldn't take over all hardware cores are available procs / 4 (so half of all physical cores) with a minimum of two. This effects the network thread pool and computation service.

Also wrap Runtime.availableProcessors() in CoreUtils so that it always returns at least one. Several people say they have seen it return -1.

    Test case for ELTInternalMessage and ELTDataSource.  Collapse the
    ExecutionSite message and the old RawProcessor.MailboxPair (horribly
    named, no?)  together into the new ELTInternalMessage.

    Maybe in the future the internal message should really just keep
    a sequence number and some separate data and it wouldn't expose
    execution site to the raw processor state block.

This change makes the DiagnosticDescriptor completely exception safe. Currently, DiagnosticDescriptor has lazily evaluated LocalizableString fields for Title, MessageFormat and Description. These have public extension points at ToString, Equals and GetHashCode methods, all of which can throw. These callbacks have now been wrapped within a try-catch for our LocalizableResourceString implementation of LocalizableString. For custom user implementations of LocalizableString (which should hopefully be rare), we wrap these within an ExceptionSafeLocalizableString which calls into the inner localizable string wrapped within a try-catch. All this is done within the DiagnosticDescriptor constructor, none of the clients have to explicitly handle the exception at use sites.

258d4aa10ab7de73fb6eba7a2f9b8772597d0470,dotnet/roslyn,"Change Windows command line argument parsing

A process in Windows is provided arguments as a flat string yet main methods in applications receive arguments as an arary of string values.  The transition between the flat string and array is done automatically by the runtime in two phases:

- Break into arguments based on spaces and grouping quotes.
- Remove extraneous quotes and backslashes.

Doing both operations at the same time serves to remove separators that are significant to the compilers.  For example:

1. /r:""a.dll,b.dll""
2. /r:a.dll,b.dll

In the main method both of these argument strings will show up as the latter value (the quotes are considered extraneous by the runtime).  Yet these represent very different values to the compiler:

1. Reference a single file named ""a.dll,b.dll""
2. Reference two files named a.dll and b.dll respectively

This change restores the native compiler behavior by manually parsing out the flat argument string.  All of the parsing methods were taken directly from the old compiler.

There are a few small changes of note here:

1. VB now considers semicolon to be a list separator as it does comma (unifies behavior between languages and other tools).
2. VB and C# now have unified behavior for collapsing backslash characters.
3. Fixed several unit tests which were validating incorrect behavior.

When our projects were last updated to a newer version of Microsoft.Net.ToolsetCompilers, NuGet didn't replace the old version--it just put the new version next to it. Every project ended up referencing both versions, and which set of compiler binaries ""won"" depended on the order they appeared in the project file. So different projects built with different compilers.

ae1d872680d85c883ae2b55cd72f47791057c23e,dotnet/roslyn,"Enable indexing of `fixed` fields without pinning.

Turns out the reason why we need pinning is the artefact of our code generation strategy - it is actually unnecessary to convert to unmanaged pointer before indexing.
Same unsafe pointer math is equally applicable when we have the receiver in the form of managed pointer. However, when it is managed (GC-tracked), we do not need to pin it.

Therefore, when a `fixed` field is used just for indexing and the unmanaged pointer is never realized, the requirement for `fixed` statement is unnecessary, regardless whether the receiver is movable or not.

NOTE:
- it is still possible to pin `fixed` buffer. That would be useful if one needs to do some elaborate pointer math or pass the pointer to the native API.
- It was always allowed to index in unmovable contexts and it was always unsafe, and still is  - in particular no range checks are performed.
- the only restriction that is gone is that you can use indexing if receiver is movable as well.
The operation is just as fast and just as unsafe as in unmovable context - in particular it performs no range checks.

Summary:
when object types are unified, we unify the types of each common prop.
this diff creates a `PropertyCompatibility` `use_op` for this and threads it
around, which causes the errors to point at the objects being unified instead of
the types of the props that are incompatible.

note that we already do this when flowing an object literal into an object
type/literal. this is specifically when two object types collide.

Summary:
A test can, via `.testconfig`, specify a script to run instead of just running `flow check`. By running that script in a subshell, we can make variables and functions available to those scripts without worrying about them affecting `runtests.sh`.

As a proof of concept, I'm sticking `assert.sh`'s functions inside `runtests.sh`. Then, I'm setting `set -e` in the subshell before executing the script.

This will come in useful in a future diff, where I'll replace calling `""$FLOW"" start` with a function `start_flow`

f703b81e9d8daf57965efb92d4daaa45e735f1b3,facebook/flow,"avoid naive unification on PolyT ~> PolyT

Summary:
Previously, we did naive unification (bidirectional subtype checking)
on `PolyT ~> PolyT`. This could cause an explosion of test cases,
especially in nested situations such as polymorphic classes hosting
polymorphic methods. And since checking such a definiion against
itself is not uncommon, it wasn't that hard to provoke the pathology
(see new test for an example that effectively hangs the typecheck).

This diff captures a subset of such cases, where the lower and upper
`PolyT`s have the same arity. In those cases it unifies the upper bounds
of each pair of type params, then instantiates each poly type with the
upper bounds as arguments, and unifies the pair. The idea is that these
unifications should be sufficient to check structural congruence.
(This leaves other easy checks unexploited, such as arity mismatches,
in the interests of keeping the diff relatively tiny. :)

My end goal here is to move filename stuff out of the parser, including
removing `Loc.source`. As a first step, this diff extracts it into its own
module, which we can eventually move from `src/parser/file_key.ml` to

one cool thing is that `File_key` also becomes `Loc.FilenameKey`, but with a

Summary:
When there are multiple exports of the same name, a map keeps only the last one. This breaks
overloading at the top level.

Maps also helped relate an `export` with its corresponding `export_info`. To preserve this relation,
we ensire that the corresponding lists are parallel. This also results in some other
simplifications, and more cleanup is possible by tightening data structures further.

296ed9ce7896790798b9b2fcb3ba8af7c43f7dbe,facebook/flow,"add magic string prefix to upgrade string literals to ""module references""

Summary:
This diff introduces a configurable string prefix that will upgrade any string literal in any position into a `$Flow$ModuleRef<$Exports<'TheModule'>>`. This lets currently hard-coded APIs like `requireLazy` be typed in userland, instead of being special-cased in the typechecker.

An example usage is a function like `ifRequired('m#Foo', Foo ==> { /* callback */ });`. This function talks to the underlying `require` internals to actually get the module exports and this new API would let this function be typed like so:

```
declare function ifRequired<TModule, TYes>(
  id: $Flow$ModuleRef<TModule>,
  cb: (module: TModule) => TYes,
);
```

Flow would then understand that the first argument to the callback is in fact the same as requiring `Foo` directly. This reduces boilerplate and `typeof` in some of the magic infrastructural APIs.

73d505b3d4270632b66fad6f1088102468b105e0,facebook/flow,"Split use_op data type into root and frame use_ops

Summary:
At this point, all `use_op`s can be neatly formatted into two categories. ""Root"" `use_op`s like `Addition`, `Cast`, and `UnknownUse`. And ""frame"" `use_op`s like `PropertyCompatibility` and `TypeArgCompatibility`. Frame `use_op`s always have a parent `use_op` which is either another frame `use_op` or a root `use_op`.

This diff formalizes this distinction by splitting `use_op` into `root_use_op` and `frame_use_op`.

With this seperation we can easily build utility types that operate on `use_op`s. In this diff, to demonstrate the utility of this refactor, I change `FlowConstraint`'s `use_op` ""cut"" logic to always cut for `Frame`s.

In future diffs, I build utilities like `fold_use_op`, `root_of_use_op`, `loc_of_root_use_op`, `string_of_use_op_rec`, and `flip_frame_use_op` which are all much easier to implement after this refactor. Before, you would need to list every `use_op` in a pattern match if you wanted to iterate through the `use_op` linked list. Now, it's much easier to build these recursive utilities.

We use `Op` as the constructor name for root `use_op`s because `Root` is taken in `constraint.ml`.

Feature is implemented by keeping a history inside the `IntersectionT` as it passes through
the speculative process, then making use of the cleaned-up API to put a bigger error
together if nothing works.

25573c899a808a6e1d1e1a1f19f664e955d2b6e2,facebook/flow,"Recover better when merging a component raises

Summary:
The merge worker tries to recover from most exceptions, but doing so isn't very
helpful, because subsequent merge operations will likely fail when attempting
to read from the leader heap or the sig context heap.

This diff improves recovery by (1) writing the appropriate leader heap entries
and (2) writing a permissive sig cx heap entry.

This diff also changes a few other things:

1. We used to catch exceptions in local type inference. I did some code
spelunking and this exception handler is very old -- certainly older than the
refactor to combine local inference and merge. I removed the catch-all handler
in local inference to consolidate logic in the merge job exception handler.

2. Because of (1), the UnknownException error message type is unused.

3. The `InferJobException` internal error type has been unused for a while.

4. I changed the signature of `Merge_service.merge_results`. Before, the
`Error` case passed a raw `exn` back to master. However, unmarshalled
exceptions can't be pattern matched. Instead, I pushed the pattern match into
the merge job exception handler.

In order to test this behavior, I added a new custom fun that triggers an
exception in a worker.

Summary:
After looking through more error message changes, I found some cases which could be better handled by the `annot_loc` logic I introduced in D6056153.

Specifically:

- All builtin accesses supposed their annotation location was the position at which they were accessed. This was incorrect especially for primitives.
- We weren't correctly repositioning type applications in some cases.

Summary:
Programs like this:

```
declare var any: any;
type X<T> = mixed;

((any: {p: number}): {p: string});
((any: X<number>): X<string>);
```

[try-Flow](https://flow.org/try/#0CYUwxgNghgTiAEA3W8oDsCeAuVmDcAUAC4YAOCAGgDwAqAfPALzwC2AlgB4jCEEAUfdNngBvUjjQBXFgCMQMAL4BKHGJwBnIjDZoA5ssIChOalNny6K+NU3a9lwkA)

Show some redundant errors. This is because when we see `{p: number} ~> {p: string}`, we check both `number ~> string` and `string ~> number`. However, these redundant errors are confusing and frustrating for users. Confusing because the user thinks there are two _seperate_ errors which need to be fixed when in fact there is only one error. (`string` is not compatible with `number`.) Frustrating because each error (especially in the case of unions/intersections) can be 20 lines long. Two identical 20-line-long error messages are not ideal.

This diff dedupes these redundant errors.

How do we do this? By flipping the reasons in `use_op`s for the reverse side of unification.

While in theory, unification is just the flows of `T ~> U` and `U ~> T`. In practice Flow implements a special ""optimized"" unification algorithm which we describe in notation as `T = U`. This unification algorithm is what we use in most of the areas where we need `T ~> U` and `U ~> T`.

In the unification `T = U`, the Flow `U ~> T` is what I will call the ""reverse side of unification."" For this side, we introduce a `UnifyFlip` frame `use_op`. So if we were in a `PropertyCompatibility(FunParam(FunCall))` `use_op` chain, the `U ~> T` Flow would make the chain `UnifyFlip(PropertyCompatibility(FunParam(FunCall)))`.

Say we then unified `number = string`. This would produce two incompatibility errrors. One with `UnifyFlip` and one without. In order to deduplicate these error messages we _flip_ the reasons in the `use_op` chain and for the final incompatibility. In `PropertyCompatibility {lower; upper}` we would perform the operation to switch `lower` and `upper`. e.g. `PropertyCompatibility {lower = upper; upper = lower}`.

After flipping, we end up with a `use_op` chain identical to our `use_op` chain without the `UnifyFlip` frame. These two `use_op` chains will produce the same error so our users will only see a single error.

This is all fine and great when we have `number = string` when both `number ~> string` and `string ~> number` are false. In this case directionality does not matter, so ""transforming"" the second error message to be identical to the first is ok. However, things get a little messier when we have a directional flow like `number = mixed`.

`number ~> mixed` is a valid subtype. However, `mixed ~> number` is not\! If we flip the reasons in our `PropertyCompatibility` error we risk calling things `lower` which are in fact the `upper`. After this diff, `lower` and `upper` might not be the right name for `use_op` reasons. A more accurate name would be `left` and `right` which represent the fact that these reasons no longer have any semantic meaning.

The second concern in flipping the reasons for `number = mixed` is in the final error message. Before we would write ""`mixed` is incompatible with `number`."" Now, in some cases, we will report ""`number` is incompatible with `mixed`."" This is fine. The language we use in error messages is not directional. ""is incompatible with"" is appropriate language for either incompatibility direction.

====================

After this diff, we see a pretty big improvement in the test error messages. This diff removes a lot of unnecessary duplication. For the errors which are directional, we flip the order of some error messages, but this is fine given that ""is incompatible with"" implies no direction.

This diff is great for our users. I've been asked multiple times about if we can dedupe the two error messages for the same issue. I'm not concerned about the message flippage in some uncommon cases impacting our ability to debug issues. We always have verbose output. If I'm at the point where we I'm analyzing non-symmetric subtyping relations I usually want verbose output anyway. The flippage for `use_op`s is purely asthetic and does not change verbose output in anyway.

Summary:
Opaque types and instance types are nominal, which means we can avoid
potentially expensive structural checks. If we compare two such types that have
the same nominal ID, we only need to compare their type arguments, if any.

Because of this, we stored the type arguments along with the instance and
opaque type representation. However, this representation was unnecessarily
complicated.

Furthermore, we stored the tparams_map, which actually includes all type
parameters in scope rather than just those pertaining to the specific type.
Space consumed for this storage was wasted and checking involving those them
was unnecessary.

Finally, the new representation, a list, preserves the order of type parameter
declaration. This is not useful now, but will be useful in a later diff.

Summary:
As a shortcut, `FunT` was sharing its `funtype` record with the
""function call"" types (`CallT`, `ApplyT`, `BindT`, etc). This is undesirable
for a few reasons

* A function parameter list (the params a function takes) is different than a
  function argument list (the arguments passed to a function). The former can
  have a single rest element at the end, while the latter can have multiple
  spread elements.
* There are a bunch of fields that `FunT` needs which the others don't

So I split them up. This also let me separate out the rest_param from the list
of params, which is structurally cleaner than including it in the list of
params.

This was mainly a OCaml compiler directed change. However,
I also grep'd for `param_tlist` to figure out which code also would care about
the `rest_param` field.

The compiler has some logic to search for known types amongst available DLLs.

With this PR we get to enable several tests that uses F# Interactive on .NET Core and more tests for the F# compiler on .NET Core

Some of the known-type-search logic is OK, but swathes of it are not so good, e.g. this stuff

This improves the search by

just having one function to do the search

moving many ""known types"" out of Abstract IL (ILGlobals) and into the F# Compiler TcGlobals. THe advantages of this is that getting started with ILGlobals is much simpler if the set of referenced types is simpler - in particular if the small set of types known to Abstract IL are all always in the primary assembly (Int32, String, Array etc.).

This is particularly important for .NET Core. I don't trust the current code to correctly find some of the more obscure types for .NET Core, since the searching was based around various assumptions for Profile 7, 78, 259.

Overall this removes a fair chunk of fragile code from the compiler.

Separately this refactors TcGlobals to be a class instead of a record (which requires fewer lines of code)

794d72e92326afe27abc3ee5f36870c1ce817fcf,jopamer/swift,"Track dependencies of SIL instructions on opened archetypes which they use

Till now there was no way in SIL to explicitly express a dependency of an instruction on any opened archetypes used by it. This was a cause of many errors and correctness issues. In many cases the code was moved around without taking into account these dependencies, which resulted in breaking the invariant that any uses of an opened archetype should be dominated by the definition of this archetype.

This patch does the following:
- Map opened archetypes to the instructions defining them, i.e. to open_existential instructions.
- Introduce a helper class SILOpenedArchetypesTracker for creating and maintaining such mappings.
- Introduce a helper class SILOpenedArchetypesState for providing a read-only API for looking up available opened archetypes.
- Each SIL instruction which uses an opened archetype as a type gets an additional opened archetype operand representing a dependency of the instruction on this archetype. These opened archetypes operands are an in-memory representation. They are not serialized. Instead, they are re-constructed when reading binary or textual SIL files.
- SILVerifier was extended to conduct more thorough checks related to the usage of opened archetypes.
"
7aa62ce8359543e92e7ee4eff30462206b6d7709,jopamer/swift,"Add an inline(late) attribute

This disables inlining at the SIL level. LLVM inlining is still enabled. We can
use this to expose one function at the SIL level - which can participate in
dominance based optimizations but which is implemented in terms of a cheap check
and an expensive check (function call) that benefits from LLVM's inlining.

Example:

The inline(late) in the example below prevents inlining of the two checks. We
can now perform dominance based optimizations on isClassOrObjExistential.
Without blocking inlining the optimizations would apply to the sizeof check
only and we would have multiple expensive function calls.

@inline(late)
func isClassOrObjExistential(t: Type) -> Bool{
  return sizeof(t) == sizeof(AnyObject) &&
    swift_isClassOrObjExistential(t)
}

We do want inlining of this function to happen at the LLVM level because the
first check is constant folded away - IRGen replaces sizeof by constants.

When we use type(of: x) on a class in an ObjC bridged context, the optimizer turns this into a SIL `value_metatype @objc` operation, which is supposed to get the dynamic type of the object as an ObjC class. This was previously lowered by IRGen into a `object_getClass` call, which extracts the isa pointer from the object, but is inconsistent with the `-class` method in ObjC or with the Swift-native behavior, which both look through artificial subclasses, proxies, and so on. This inconsistency led to observably different behavior between debug and release builds and between ObjC-bridged and native entry points, so provide an alternative runtime entry point that replicates the behavior of getting a native Swift class.

a06cacbfcb216508d7f31e060e7bae0acfedab40,jopamer/swift,"[projection] Introduce two new types NewProjection and NewProjectionPath.

NewProjection is a re-architecting of Projection that supports all of
the same functionality as Projection but in 1/3 of the original size (in
the common case). It is able to accomplish this by removing the base
type out of NewProjection itself and into users such as
NewProjectionPath. Thus NewProjection is now strictly an index from some
parent type rather than being a parent type and an index.

NewProjectionPath also has all of the same functionality as
ProjectionPath, but due to NewProjection being smaller than Projection
is smaller than ProjectionPath.

Used together NewProjection/NewProjectionPath yields the same output as
Projection/ProjectionPath when evaluating the LSLocation dumping tests.

Additionally, NewProjection is more flexible than Projection and will
for free give us the ability to perform AA on index_addr/index_raw_addr
as well as be able to integrate casts into the projection paradigm.

libSyntax nodes don't maintain absolute source location on each

diagnostics from libSyntax entities.

With the observation that our current implementation of the source

bridging by using the newly-added syntax visitor. Also, we moved the function
from RawSyntax to Syntax for better visibility.

To test this source location calculation, we added a new action in
swift-syntax-test. This action parses a given file as a
SourceFileSyntax, calculates the absolute location of the
EOF token in the SourceFileSyntax, and dump the buffer from the start
of the input file to the absolute location of the EOF. Finally, we compare

This seems to more than fix a performance regression that we
detected on a metadata-allocation microbenchmark.

A few months ago, I improved the metadata cache representation
and changed the metadata allocation scheme to primarily use malloc.
Previously, we'd been using malloc in the concurrent tree data
structure but a per-cache slab allocator for the metadata itself.
At the time, I was concerned about the overhead of per-cache
allocators, since many metadata patterns see only a small number
of instantiations.  That's still an important factor, so in the
new scheme we're using a global allocator; but instead of using
malloc for individual allocations, we're using a slab allocator,
which should have better peak, single-thread performance, at the
cost of not easily supporting deallocation.  Deallocation is
only used for metadata when there's contention on the cache, and
specifically only when there's contention for the same key, so
leaking a little isn't the worst thing in the world.

The initial slab is a 64K globally-allocated buffer.
Successive slabs are 16K and allocated with malloc.

Replace 'constant_ref' with 'function_ref', which references a SILFunction directly, and 'global_addr', which references a global variable VarDecl. Get rid of the SILConstant-to-SILFunction mapping in SILModule and replace it with an ilist of SILFunctions. Allow SILFunctions to be 'external' by not having any blocks in their body. 

For now, SILFunctions still carry around their SILConstant ""name"", because name mangling and IRGen still rely on access to the original decl in order to recover IRGen information, which unfortunately leaves IRGen's CodeRefs in a gross, awkward intermediate state.

0af2845c6ddfb2e3e2afa5569cec278dd4bdf9e6,jopamer/swift,"SILGen: Emission of materializeForSet for generic subscripts

First, use the correct generic environment to compute the substituted
storage type. Substitutions derived from 'self' are not enough,
because we also want the archetypes of the generic subscript's
innermost generic parameters.

Also, use the method and witness_method calling conventions for the
materializeForSet callback, depending on if we have a protocol
witness or concrete implementation.

Since the materializeForSet callback is called with a more
abstract type at the call site than the actual function type
of the callback, we used to rely on these two SIL types being
ABI compatible:

@convention(thin) <Self : P, T, U) (..., Self.Type) -> ()
@convention(thin) <T, U> (..., Foo<T, U>.Type) -> ()

The IRGen lowering is roughly the following -- the call site
passes two unused parameters, but that's fine:

(..., Self.Type*, Self.Type*, Self.P*)
(..., Foo<T, U>.Type*)

However if the callback has its own generic parameters because
the subscript is generic, we might have SIL types like so,

@convention(thin) <Self : P, T, U, V) (..., Self.Type) -> ()
@convention(thin) <T, U, V> (..., Foo<T, U>.Type) -> ()

And the IRGen lowering is the following:

(..., Self.Type*, Self.Type*, Self.P*, V.Type*)
(..., Foo<T, U>.Type*, V.Type*)

The parameters no longer line up, because the caller still passes
the two discarded arguments, and type metadata for V cannot be
derived from the Self metadata so must be passed separately.

The witness_method calling convention is designed to solve this
problem; it puts the Self metadata and protocol conformance last,
so if you have these SIL types:

@convention(witness_method) <Self : P, T, U, V) (..., swiftself Self.Type) -> ()
@convention(witness_method) <T, U, V> (..., swiftself Foo<T, U>.Type) -> ()

The IRGen lowering is the following:

(..., Self.Type*, V.Type*, Self.Type*, Self.P*)
(..., Foo<T, U>.Type*, V.Type*, Self.Type*, unused i8*)

However, the problem is now that witness_method and thin functions
are not ABI compatible, because thin functions don't have a
distinguished 'self', which is passed differently in LLVM's swiftcc
calling convention:

@convention(witness_method) <Self : P, T, U, V) (..., Self.Type) -> ()
@convention(thin) <T, U, V> (..., Foo<T, U>.Type) -> ()

So instead of using 'thin' representation for the concrete callback
case, use 'method', which is essentially the same as 'thin' except if
the last parameter is pointer-size, it is passed as the 'self' value.

This makes everything work out.

Previously, we were using the Objective-C names to help determine
whether a declaration is an override or not. This is broken, because
we should determine overrides based on the Swift rules for
overriding, then (later) check that the Objective-C runtime will see
the same override behavior that the Swift runtime does. Address this
problem, both by taking the Objective-C selector out of the equation
when matching overrides (except for diagnostic purposes) and by
performing better validation of the Objective-C names for the
overriding vs. overridden methods/properties.

The motivating case here (from rdar://problem/18998564) is an
Objective-C initializer:

  -(instancetype)initString:(NSString *)string;

When trying to override this in a Swift subclass, one naturally
writes:

  override init(string: String)

which implicitly has the selector initWithString:. We ended up in an
unfortunate place where we rejected the override (because the
selectors didn't match) with a crummy diagnostic, but omitting the
""override"" would result in a different conflict with the superclass.

Now, we'll treat this as an override and complain that one needs to
rename the method by adding ""@objc(initString:)"" (with a Fix-It, of
course). This fixes rdar://problem/18998564, but it is not ideal: the
complete solution (covered by rdar://problem/19812955) involves
reworking the dance between override and @objc so that we compute
'override' first (ignoring @objc-ness entirely), and let the
@objc'ness of the overridden declaration both imply @objc for the
overriding declaration and implicitly fix the selector. However, such
a change is too risky right now, hence the radar clone.

More groundwork for protocols with superclass constraints.
In several places we need to distinguish between existential

existential types containing a protocol with a superclass
constraint.

This is similar to how I can write 'AnyObject & Proto', or
write 'Proto1 & Proto2' where Proto1 has an ': AnyObject'
in its inheritance clause.

Note that some of the usages will be revisited later as
I do more refactoring and testing. This is just a first pass.

much faster because entire inlined-at chains can now be cached. This
means that SIL is no longer preserve the inlining history (i.e., ((a

5a2f48e3be61607bd76cab50b63886cf305bad41,jopamer/swift,"Add a Builtin.BridgeObject type.

This is a type that has ownership of a reference while allowing access to the
spare bits inside the pointer, but which can also safely hold an ObjC tagged pointer
reference (with no spare bits of course). It additionally blesses one
Foundation-coordinated bit with the meaning of ""has swift refcounting"" in order
to get a faster short-circuit to native refcounting. It supports the following
builtin operations:

- Builtin.castToBridgeObject<T>(ref: T, bits: Builtin.Word) ->
  Builtin.BridgeObject

  Creates a BridgeObject that contains the bitwise-OR of the bit patterns of
  ""ref"" and ""bits"". It is the user's responsibility to ensure ""bits"" doesn't
  interfere with the reference identity of the resulting value. In other words,
  it is undefined behavior unless:

    castReferenceFromBridgeObject(castToBridgeObject(ref, bits)) === ref

  This means ""bits"" must be zero if ""ref"" is a tagged pointer. If ""ref"" is a real
  object pointer, ""bits"" must not have any non-spare bits set (unless they're
  already set in the pointer value). The native discriminator bit may only be set
  if the object is Swift-refcounted.

- Builtin.castReferenceFromBridgeObject<T>(bo: Builtin.BridgeObject) -> T

  Extracts the reference from a BridgeObject.

- Builtin.castBitPatternFromBridgeObject(bo: Builtin.BridgeObject) -> Builtin.Word

  Presents the bit pattern of a BridgeObject as a Word.

BridgeObject's bits are set up as follows on the various platforms:

i386, armv7:

  No ObjC tagged pointers
  Swift native refcounting flag bit: 0x0000_0001
  Other available spare bits:        0x0000_0002

x86_64:

  Reserved for ObjC tagged pointers: 0x8000_0000_0000_0001
  Swift native refcounting flag bit: 0x0000_0000_0000_0002
  Other available spare bits:        0x7F00_0000_0000_0004

arm64:

  Reserved for ObjC tagged pointers: 0x8000_0000_0000_0000
  Swift native refcounting flag bit: 0x4000_0000_0000_0000
  Other available spare bits:        0x3F00_0000_0000_0007

TODO: BridgeObject doesn't present any extra inhabitants. It ought to at least provide null as an extra inhabitant for Optional.

74589d788e4de05d450be5c93fa7454a31de580a,jopamer/swift,"Make ObjC-ness implicit to ObjC-inherited classes.

Add 'isObjC' as a property of ValueDecl, and set it during type checking if a class is either explicitly annotated with an [objc] attribute or inherits from an isObjC class, or if a func is a method of an isObjC class. Tweak the ClangImporter and other places that summon magic ValueDecl nodes to set up the decls they synthesize as isObjC. Replace logic in typechecking and IRGen that branched on the 'isObjC' attribute to now branch on the 'isObjC' property of ValueDecls.

Update for SE-0107: UnsafeRawPointer

This adds a ""mutating"" initialize to UnsafePointer to make
Immutable -> Mutable conversions explicit.

These are quick fixes to stdlib, overlays, and test cases that are necessary
in order to remove arbitrary UnsafePointer conversions.

Many cases can be expressed better up by reworking the surrounding
code, but we first need a working starting point.

b1573a97e17b518723ab3f906eb6d521caed196d,kfowler/emacs,"Use alignas to fix GCALIGN-related bugs

Use alignas and unions to specify alignments of objects needing
addresses that are at least a multiple of GCALIGNMENT.  Using
these standard C facilities should be safer than relying on ad hoc
and poorly-understood features like GCC’s __attribute__
((aligned (N))), the root cause for recent porting bugs like
Bug#29040.  The alignas macro was standardized by C11 and Gnulib
supports alignas for pre-C11 platforms.  I have tested this on Sun
Studio 12 sparc (2007) and GCC 4.4.7 x86-64 (2012) as well as on
more recent platforms like GCC 7.2.1 (2017) on Fedora 26 (both
x86-64 and x86).
* lib-src/make-docfile.c (close_emacs_globals): lispsym is now
just an array of struct Lisp_Symbol, since struct Lisp_Symbol is
now properly aligned.  All uses changed.
* src/alloc.c (NEXT_FREE_LISP_STRING): Just use the new u.next
member; this is simpler and safer than casting a pointer that
might not be aligned properly.
(aligned_Lisp_Symbol): Remove.  No longer needed, now that struct
Lisp_Symbol is aligned properly.  All uses replaced with struct
Lisp_Symbol.
* src/lisp.h (GCALIGNED): Remove, as it does not work as expected:
it can cause the natural alignment to be ignored.  All uses
replaced by unions with a ‘char alignas (GCALIGNMENT)’ member as
described below.
(struct Lisp_Symbol, struct Lisp_Cons, struct Lisp_String):
Change definition from ‘struct TAG { MEMBERS };’ to
‘struct TAG { union { struct { MEMBERS } s; char alignas
(GCALIGNMENT) gcaligned; } u; };’.  This guarantees ‘struct TAG’
to have an alignment that at least max (GCALIGNMENT, N) where N is
its old alignment.  All uses like ‘PTR->MEMBER’ changed to
‘PTR->u.s.MEMBER’; these uses were supposed to be mostly private
anyway.  Verify that the resulting ‘struct TAG’ is properly
aligned for Emacs.
(union vectorlike_header): New member ‘gcaligned’ to guarantee
that this type, and its containing types like ‘struct Lisp_Subr’,
‘struct buffer’ and ‘struct thread_state’, are all properly
aligned for Emacs.
(struct Lisp_String): New union member ‘next’, for the benefit
of NEXT_FREE_LISP_STRING.
(union Aligned_Cons, union Aligned_String): Remove.  All uses
replaced by struct Lisp_Cons and struct Lisp_String, since they
are now properly aligned.
(USE_STACK_CONS, USE_STACK_STRING): Simplify now that we can
assume struct Lisp_Cons and struct Lisp_String are properly
aligned.

It was reported by Chris Torek in 1983 even before GNU Emacs existed,

a predecessor of GNU Emacs, but GNU Emacs happened to have the
same common flaw.)  See Torek's Usenet posting

 (reseat): call handle_stop_backwards to recompute prev_stop and
 base_level_stop for the new position.

 and prev_pos.  Compare for strict equality in
 BUFFER_POS_REACHED_P.

ac8d22de2394e03ba4a77d8fd24381147aafb1d3,napatech/dpdk,"ethdev: flatten RSS configuration in flow API

Since its inception, the rte_flow RSS action has been relying in part on
external struct rte_eth_rss_conf for compatibility with the legacy RSS API.
This structure lacks parameters such as the hash algorithm to use, and more
recently, a method to tell which layer RSS should be performed on [1].

Given struct rte_eth_rss_conf will never be flexible enough to represent a
complete RSS configuration (e.g. RETA table), this patch supersedes it by
extending the rte_flow RSS action directly.

A subsequent patch will add a field to use a non-default RSS hash
algorithm. To that end, a field named ""types"" replaces the field formerly
known as ""rss_hf"" and standing for ""RSS hash functions"" as it was
confusing. Actual RSS hash function types are defined by enum
rte_eth_hash_function.

This patch updates all PMDs and example applications accordingly.

It breaks ABI compatibility for the following public functions:

- rte_flow_copy()
- rte_flow_create()
- rte_flow_query()
- rte_flow_validate()

71f2384328651dced05eceee87119a71f0cf16a7,napatech/dpdk,"eventdev: introduce event driven programming model

In a polling model, lcores poll ethdev ports and associated
rx queues directly to look for packet. In an event driven model,
by contrast, lcores call the scheduler that selects packets for
them based on programmer-specified criteria. Eventdev library
adds support for event driven programming model, which offer
applications automatic multicore scaling, dynamic load balancing,
pipelining, packet ingress order maintenance and
synchronization services to simplify application packet processing.

By introducing event driven programming model, DPDK can support
both polling and event driven programming models for packet processing,
and applications are free to choose whatever model
(or combination of the two) that best suits their needs.

This patch adds the eventdev specification header file.

380a7aab1ae2894fa598d8c51962778670996e4a,napatech/dpdk,"mbuf: rename deprecated VLAN flags

PKT_RX_VLAN_PKT and PKT_RX_QINQ_PKT are deprecated for a while.
As explained in [1], these flags were kept to let the applications and
PMDs move to the new flag. There is also a need to support Rx vlan
offload without vlan strip (at least for the ixgbe driver).

This patch renames the old flags for this feature, knowing that some
PMDs were using PKT_RX_VLAN_PKT and PKT_RX_QINQ_PKT to indicate that
the vlan tci has been saved in the mbuf structure.

It is likely that some PMDs do not set the proper flags when doing vlan
offload, and it would be worth making a pass on all of them.

This is a backwards compatible, but major upgrade.

startup sequence has been completely rewritten. Startup script will now split into a different script for each platform

system library has been merged with startup library

Most important string and array functions have been moved from their libraries to the startup library so that the required functions are available even though the library files havent been loaded yet

Added ""core"" class, which will generate a $core object. This object will do an important step of the startup sequence, contain the $sql objects, contains a $core->register where globally required variables can be stored.

Performed major code cleanup from startup crap

Completely rewrote the uncaught exception handler

Major general code cleanup

Moved process_* functions to new process library

Moved detect_* functions to new detect library

Added new tasks library, with management script. This library can manage background task execution

json_encode_custom() now again uses PHPs json_encode() (but can optionally still use its own internal version if needed)

Cleaned up the logging system. Removed the old log_console(), removed cli_log(), removed log_screen(), removed log_message(). Now only remain log_console() (which logs to file in case of PLATFORM_HTTP), log_file() and log_database()

Major cleanup (nearly rewrite) of the validate library. Most validate methods now optionally allow for empty values (and will then force those empty values to the specified datatype)

Reworked cli text coloring. All functions should now be able to set background colors as well, and when non existing colors are used, the system wont crash but give a nice warning

Fixed various scanimage library functions

Renamed PLATFORM_SHELL to PLATFORM_CLI

Fixed loads of command line issues

Loads and loads of minor fixes

483 We do a poor job of handling threads which are in a join
	When doing an async break we capture the threads stacks even if we need to do it off the thread which is running.  If the thread later finishes its join we’ll re-capture the stack and re-evaluate the variables locally on the thread to get a more accurate set of variables.

Purges Server, MasterServices, and RegionServerServices from
CoprocessorEnvironments. Replaces removed functionality with
a set of carefully curated methods on the *CoprocessorEnvironment
implementations (Varies by CoprocessorEnvironment in that the
MasterCoprocessorEnvironment has Master-type facility exposed,
and so on).

A few core Coprocessors that should long ago have been converted
to be integral, violate their context; e.g. a RegionCoprocessor
wants free access to a hosting RegionServer (which may or may not
be present). Rather than let these violators make us corrupte the
CP API, instead, we've made up a hacky system that allows core
Coprocessors access to internals. A new CoreCoprocessor Annotation
has been introduced. When loading Coprocessors, if the instance is
annotated CoreCoprocessor, we pass it an Environment that has been
padded w/ extra-stuff. On invocation, CoreCoprocessors know how to
route their way to these extras in their environment.

See the *CoprocessoHost for how the do the check for CoreCoprocessor
and pass a fatter *Coprocessor, one that allows getting of either
a RegionServerService or MasterService out of the environment
via Marker Interfaces.

Main changes:
- ProcedureInfo and LockInfo were removed, we use JSON instead of them
- Procedure and LockedResource are their server side equivalent
- Procedure protobuf state_data became obsolate, it is only kept for
reading previously written WAL
- Procedure protobuf contains a state_message field, which stores the internal
state messages (Any type instead of bytes)
- Procedure.serializeStateData and deserializeStateData were changed slightly
- Procedures internal states are available on client side
- Procedures are displayed on web UI and in shell in the following jruby format:
  { ID => '1', PARENT_ID = '-1', PARAMETERS => [ ..extra state information.. ] }

CompactionRequest was removed from CP in HBASE-18453, this change reintroduces
CompatcionRequest to CP as a read-only interface called CompactionRequest.
The CompactionRequest class is renamed to CompactionRequestImpl.

Additionally, this change removes selectionTimeInNanos from CompactionRequest and
uses selectionTime as a replacement. This means that CompactionRequest:toString
is modified and compare as well.

Summary: Noticed this when I was writing the documentation for the abstract interpretation framework and was curious about why `Ondemand.analyze_proc` needs the type environment. It turns out that the type environment is only used to transform/normalize Infer bi-abduction specs before storing them to disk, but this can be done elsewhere. Doing this normalization elsewhere simplifies the on-demand API, which is a win for all of its clients.

4c8a20f43b5caeada2edac82c2e6f3efe266fb0d,keybase/client,"cr: support setAttr(mtime) for directories

Previously, we treated all setAttr(mtime) operations as if they
happened on files, when in fact that is a valid operation for a
directory. Even though setAttrs affect directory entries, they really
apply to the target node itself (which may be moved around in another
branch).  Thus, the CR chains ""pin"" setAttr operations to the node,
and then apply them to the node's final merged parent block.

This is somewhat straightforward with files, since all file-related
operations work this way (syncOps+setAttrOps).  With directories
however, this isn't the case, since a directory may both have its
mtime set and have a new entry created within it; therefore, we must
pick and choose which operations get applied to the parent block
containing the directory's directory entry.

To make this happen, this commit does the following:

* A crChain identifies a file type by fetching the actual block, when
  it isn't possible to identify it using operations alone.

* ConflictResolver splits up the actions relating to a directory's
  mtime into a separate list, and applied them to the directory's
  parent.  If the parent didn't yet have any actions, it must be added
  to the list of unmergedPaths.

* Add a new error type for when a block can't be decoded into its
  expected type, so we can easily distinguish that and use it to help
  determine a chain's type.

* If a directory's mtime is modified in both branches, resolve the
  conflict by creating a symlink (imbued with the unmerged mtime)
  pointing to the real entry.

* In order to support reading the mtime of a symlink, change the DSL
  to not resolve the final symlink in a path for the mtime operations,
  and fix up the libkbfs engine accordingly.

793cf7f7cf1821fd5d473a78edab356bc7e98a85,cloudera/Impala,"Add Catalog Service and support for automatic metadata refresh

The Impala CatalogService manages the caching and dissemination of cluster-wide metadata.
The CatalogService combines the metadata from the Hive Metastore, the NameNode,
and potentially additional sources in the future. The CatalogService uses the
StateStore to broadcast metadata updates across the cluster.
The CatalogService also directly handles executing metadata updates request from
impalad servers (DDL requests). It exposes a Thrift interface to allow impalads to
directly connect execute their DDL operations.
The CatalogService has two main components - a C++ server that implements StateStore
integration, Thrift service implementiation, and exporting of the debug webpage/metrics.
The other main component is the Java Catalog that manages caching and updating of of all
the metadata. For each StateStore heartbeat, a delta of all metadata updates is broadcast
to the rest of the cluster.

Some Notes On the Changes
---
* The metadata is all sent as thrift structs. To do this all catalog objects (Tables/Views,
Databases, UDFs) have thrift struct to represent them. These are sent with each statestore
delta update.
* The existing Catalog class has been seperated into two seperate sub-classes. An
ImpladCatalog and a CatalogServiceCatalog. See the comments on those classes for more
details.

What is working:
* New CatalogService created
* Working with statestore delta updates and latest UDF changes
* DDL performed on Node 1 is now visible on all other nodes without a ""refresh"".
* Each DDL operation against the Catalog Service will return the catalog version that
  contains the change. An impalad will wait for the statestore heartbeat that contains this
  version before returning from the DDL comment.
* All table types (Hbase, Hdfs, Views) getting their metadata propagated properly
* Block location information included in CS updates and used by Impalads
* Column and table stats included in CS updates and used by Impalads
* Query tests are all passing

Still TODO:
* Directly return catalog object metadata from DDL requests
* Poll the Hive Metastore to detect new/dropped/modified tables
* Reorganize the FE code for the Catalog Service. I don't think we want everything in the
  same JAR.

41c1d24da9d7e5c267b04eff434932015831faa4,cloudera/Impala,"Enable lazy loading of table metadata for the CatalogService/Impalad

This change adds support for lazy loading of table metadata to the
CatalogService/Impalad. The way this works is that the CatalogService initially
sends out an update with only the databases and table names (wrapped as
IncompleteTables). When an Impalad encounters one of these tables, it will contact
the catalog service to get the metadata, possibly triggering a metadata load if the
catalog server has not yet loaded this table.

With these changes the catalog server starts up in just seconds, even for large
metastores since it only needs to call into the metastore to get the list of tables
and databases. The performance of ""invalidate metadata"" also improves for the same reason.

I also picked up the catalog cleanup patch I had to make the APIs a bit more consistent and
remove the need for using a LoadingCache for databases.

This also fixes up the FE tests to run in a more realistic fashion. The FE tests now run
against catalog object recieved from the catalog server. This actually turned up some bugs
in our previous test configuration where we were not running with the correct column stats
(we were always running with avgSerializedSize = slotSize).  This changed some plans so the
planner tests needed to be updated.

Still TODO:
This does not include the changes to perform background metadata loading. I will send
that out as a separate patch on top of this.

d94013a7cf68aad6e0ef49fe8fb2d348220261c1,cloudera/Impala,"Metric changes

This patch reworks a lot of the metrics subsystem, laying much of the
groundwork for unifying runtime profiles and metrics in the future, as
well as enabling better rendering of metric data in our webpages, and
richer integration with thirdparty monitoring tools like CM.

There are lots of changes. The most significant are below.

TODO (incomplete list):

* Add descriptions for all metrics
* Settle on a standard hierarchy for process-wide metric groups
* Add path-based resolution for searching for metrics (i.e. resolve
  ""group1.group2.metric_name"")
* Add a histogram metric type

Improvements for all metrics:

** New 'description' field, which allows a human-readable description to
   be provided for each metric.
** Metrics must serialise themselves to JSON via the RapidJson
   library (all by-hand JSON serialisation has been removed).
** Metrics are contained in MetricGroups (replacing the old 'Metrics'
   class), which are hierarchically arranged to make grouping metrics
   into smaller subsystems more natural.
** Metrics are rendered via the new webserver templating engine,
   replacing the old /metrics endpoint. The old /jsonmetrics endpoint is
   retained for backwards compatibility.

Improvements for 'simple' metrics:

** SimpleMetric replaces the old PrimitiveMetric class (using much of
   the same code), and are metrics whose value does not itself have
   relevant structure (as opposed to sets, lists, etc).
** SimpleMetrics have 'kinds' (counter, gauge, property etc)
** ... and units (from TCounterType), to make pretty-printing easier.

a091d9ca0680583ac3ab3d2ecf722d41aded07f4,cloudera/Impala,"IMPALA-5844: use a MemPool for expr result allocations

This is also a step towards IMPALA-2399 (remove QueryMaintenance()).

""local"" allocations containing expression results (either intermediate
or final results) have the following properties:
* They are usually small allocations
* They can be made frequently (e.g. every function call)
* They are owned and managed by the Impala runtime
* They are freed in bulk at various points in query execution.

A MemPool (i.e. bump allocator) is the right mechanism to manage
allocations with the above properties. Before this patch
FunctionContext's used a FreePool + vector of allocations to emulate the
above behaviour. This patch switches to using a MemPool to bring these
allocations in line with the rest of the codebase.

The steps required to do this conversion.
* Use a MemPool for FunctionContext local allocations.
* Identify appropriate MemPools for all of the local allocations from
  function contexts so that the memory lifetime is correct.
* Various cleanup and documentation of existing MemPools.
* Replaces calls to FreeLocalAllocations() with calls to
  MemPool::Clear()

More involved surgery was required in a few places:
* Made the Sorter own its comparator, exprs and MemPool.
* Remove FunctionContextImpl::ReallocateLocal() and just have
  StringFunctions::Replace() do the doubling itself to avoid
  the need for a special interface. Worst-case this doubles
  the memory requirements for Replace() since n / 2 + n / 4
  + n / 8 + .... bytes of memory could be wasted instead of recycled
  for an n-byte output string.
* Provide a way redirect agg fn Serialize()/Finalize() allocations
  to come directly from the output RowBatch's MemPool. This is
  also potentially applicable to other places where we currently
  copy out strings from local allocations, e.g.
  AnalyticEvalNode::AddResultTuple() and Tuple::MaterializeExprs().
* --stress_free_pool_alloc was changed to instead intercept at the
  FunctionContext layer so that it retains the old behaviour even
  though allocations do not all come from FreePools.

The ""local"" allocation concept was not exposed directly in udf.h so this
patch also renames them to better reflect that they're used for expr
results.

Testing:
* ran exhaustive and ASAN

If the requirement is removed from the spy action's action enabler the player
can do the action even if the actor (spy) is out of moves. Without moves the
actor will be limited to act against his own tile. It therefore has to be on or
be transported to the target tile.

A spy unit using its final move will lose its focus. If the player had wanted it
to act against the tile the unit ended up on he would have selected the action
in stead of ""Keep moving"" choosing how to spend the last move fragment.

71c4c61f0d9c3cdc34f7387716aa507945d877ab,freeciv/freeciv,"Mark actions with rare act sel dlg pop ups

A unit's ability to perform an action can cause the action selection dialog
to pop up before the player asks for it. It can happen when a unit is
transported into a city it is capable of performing an action to. It can
happen when a unit tries to move to a tile that has a target it may act
against.

This behavior isn't desirable for all actions. An action that can be
performed against almost every tile will annoy the user with a pop up each
time it moves. Being offered to do something dangerous is a situation where
it would be destructive can lead to the player's reflexes to accidentally
perform it.

Introduce the new action property rare_pop_up. A unit's ability to perform
an action where it is true will only pop up the action selection dialog
before the player asks for it in exceptional cases. At the moment that is
limited to the case when the player tries to move a unit to a tile it can't
move to but can perform the action to.

Have the rare_pop_up action property replace the special rules for when a
(potentially) legal action with a tile target can pop up the action
selection dialog.

Give the rare_pop_up action property to the actions ""Explode Nuclear"",
""Found City"", ""Join City"" and ""Recycle Unit"".

Inspired by Marko Lindqvist <cazfi>'s ""user_initiated"" action property idea
in patch #6168.

There are a few issues with the current virAtomic APIs

 - They require use of a virAtomicInt struct instead of a plain
   int type
 - Several of the methods do not implement memory barriers
 - The methods do not implement compiler re-ordering barriers
 - There is no Win32 native impl

The GLib library has a nice LGPLv2+ licensed impl of atomic
ops that works with GCC, Win32, or pthreads.h that addresses
all these problems. The main downside to their code is that
the pthreads impl uses a single global mutex, instead of
a per-variable mutex. Given that it does have a Win32 impl
though, we don't expect anyone to seriously use the pthread.h
impl, so this downside is not significant.

* .gitignore: Ignore test case
* configure.ac: Check for which atomic ops impl to use
* src/Makefile.am: Add viratomic.c
* src/nwfilter/nwfilter_dhcpsnoop.c: Switch to new atomic
  ops APIs and plain int datatype

ccff335f8384892645f1a242214d58eb125fa5a7,libvirt/libvirt,"Support for static routes on a virtual bridge

network: static route support for <network>

This patch adds the <route> subelement of <network> to define a static
route.  the address and prefix (or netmask) attribute identify the
destination network, and the gateway attribute specifies the next hop
address (which must be directly reachable from the containing
<network>) which is to receive the packets destined for
""address/(prefix|netmask)"".

These attributes are translated into an ""ip route add"" command that is
executed when the network is started. The command used is of the
following form:

  ip route add <address>/<prefix> via <gateway> \
               dev <virbr-bridge> proto static metric <metric>

Tests are done to validate that the input data are correct.  For
example, for a static route ip definition, the address must be a
network address and not a host address.  Additional checks are added
to ensure that the specified gateway is directly reachable via this
network (i.e. that the gateway IP address is in the same subnet as one
of the IP's defined for the network).

prefix='0' is supported for both family='ipv4' address='0.0.0.0'
netmask='0.0.0.0' or prefix='0', and for family='ipv6' address='::',
prefix=0', although care should be taken to not override a desired
system default route.

Anytime an attempt is made to define a static route which *exactly*
duplicates an existing static route (for example, address=::,
prefix=0, metric=1), the following error message will be sent to
syslog:

    RTNETLINK answers: File exists

This can be overridden by decreasing the metric value for the route
that should be preferred, or increasing the metric for the route that
shouldn't be preferred (and is thus in place only in anticipation that
the preferred route may be removed in the future).  Caution should be
used when manipulating route metrics, especially for a default route.

Note: The use of the command-line interface should be replaced by
direct use of libnl so that error conditions can be handled better.  But,
that is being left as an exercise for another day.

b9dd878ff8a03a605865d347e01c0b80b0ee7798,libvirt/libvirt,"util: make it easier to grab only regular command exit

Auditing all callers of virCommandRun and virCommandWait that
passed a non-NULL pointer for exit status turned up some
interesting observations.  Many callers were merely passing
a pointer to avoid the overall command dying, but without
caring what the exit status was - but these callers would
be better off treating a child death by signal as an abnormal
exit.  Other callers were actually acting on the status, but
not all of them remembered to filter by WIFEXITED and convert
with WEXITSTATUS; depending on the platform, this can result
in a status being reported as 256 times too big.  And among
those that correctly parse the output, it gets rather verbose.
Finally, there were the callers that explicitly checked that
the status was 0, and gave their own message, but with fewer
details than what virCommand gives for free.

So the best idea is to move the complexity out of callers and
into virCommand - by default, we return the actual exit status
already cleaned through WEXITSTATUS and treat signals as a
failed command; but the few callers that care can ask for raw
status and act on it themselves.

ddf3bd32ce1246d466f4ffc12ee3a8e41db1d0e9,libvirt/libvirt,"Rewrite all the DTrace/SystemTAP probing

The libvirtd daemon had a few crude system tap probes. Some of
these were broken during the RPC rewrite. The new modular RPC
code is structured in a way that allows much more effective
tracing. Instead of trying to hook up the original probes,
define a new set of probes for the RPC and event code.

The master probes file is now src/probes.d.  This contains
probes for virNetServerClientPtr, virNetClientPtr, virSocketPtr
virNetTLSContextPtr and virNetTLSSessionPtr modules. Also add
probes for the poll event loop.

The src/dtrace2systemtap.pl script can convert the probes.d
file into a libvirt_probes.stp file to make use from systemtap
much simpler.

The src/rpc/gensystemtap.pl script can generate a set of
systemtap functions for translating RPC enum values into
printable strings. This works for all RPC header enums (program,
type, status, procedure) and also the authentication enum

The PROBE macro will automatically generate a VIR_DEBUG
statement, so any place with a PROBE can remove any existing
manual DEBUG statements.

* daemon/libvirtd.h: Remove probe macros

The HNET C108
(http://www.szhwtech88.com/Product-product-cid-100-id-4374.html) is a
mifi based on MT7602A, which has the following specifications:

* CPU: MT7620A
* 1x 10/100Mbps Ethernet.
* 16 MB Flash.
* 64 MB RAM.
* 1x USB 2.0 port. Only power is connected, this port is meant for
charging other devices.
* 1x mini-PCIe slots.
* 1x SIM slots.
* 1x 2.4Ghz WIFI.
* 1x button.
* 6000 mAh battery.
* 5x controllable LEDs.

Works:
* Wifi.
* Switch.
* mini-PCIe slot. Only tested with a USB device (a modem).
* SIM slot.
* Sysupgrade.
* Button (reset).

Not working (also applies to the factory firmware):
* Wifi LED. It is always switched on, there is no relation to the
up/down state or activity of the wireless interface.

Not tested:
* SD card reader.

Notes:
* The C108 has no dedicated status LED. I therefore set the LAN LED as
status LED.

Installation:
The router comes pre-installed with OpenWRT, including a variant of
Luci. The initial firmware install can be done through this UI,
following normal procedure. I.e., access the UI and update the firmware
using the sysupgrade-image. Remember to select that you do not want to
keep existing settings.

Recovery:
If you brick the device, the C108 supports recovery using TFTP. Keep the
reset button pressed for ~5sec when booting to trigger TFTP. Set the
address of the network interface on your machine to 10.10.10.3/24, and
rename your image file to Kernal.bin.

5b7278764c89c1823156c4bb71350fb0a9bede9e,prestodb/presto,"Add support for range predicate pushdowns

This work is a complete refactor of how we generate Partitions in the planning/execution phases.
Instead of generating Partitions after planning, we now integrate the generation directly
into the optimization planning phase so that we can iterate our plan based on data returned
by the Partitions that we discover. This not only provides a number of opportunities for
optimization, but also significantly simplifies the amount of cross-talk between the
split generation and the planning phases. As a result of these changes, it makes
it much easier to build native range predicate push downs.

b256e7a62c4d5b2f5b10faf889c893a62ec4f9c4,prestodb/presto,"Use createUnboundedVarcharType in Hive connector

Use explicit VarcharType.createUnboundedVarcharType instead of VarcharType.VARCHAR
constant in Hive connector.

Varchar type should always be parametrized, and it must be checked with
`Varchars.isVarcharType(type)` instead of `type.equals(VarcharType.VARCHAR)`,
so the varchar with the length less then MAX_LENGTH is being handled properly.

Having the `VarcharType.VARCHAR` constant is confusing and error prone, cause it
suggests user that the only one single unparametrized `VARCHAR` type is available.

After refactor all the other connecotors and `VARCHAR` operators that constant
must be removed at all.

9e338572997510630f8efbd9cdfadc6c9c23c117,servo/webrender,"Introduce GPU resource cache.

This adds an incremental LRU cache that can be used to store values
that vertex shaders need to access.

The intent is to replace the use of the GPU store type, which
currently uploads the entire buffer each frame, and has a lot
of limitations (such as requiring allocation up front).

The new interface supports building GPU data on demand, as required,
which will improve CPU a lot for large pages.

For now, I have ported borders and rectangles to use the new type.
The patch is already large enough - this will allow us to port
each primitive type to use the GPU cache incrementally. The current
code also doesn't actually take advantage of building the data on
demand yet - they are just copied when needed.

Follow up work includes:
 * Porting more types to use the GPU cache.
 * Removing the old gpu store interfaces.
 * Profiling and optimizing various GL incremental update APIs.
 * Supporting resizing of the GPU cache backing store.

7b5a93d41f99788bb378880d2db0b44896a1b63b,servo/webrender,"Reduce per-instance size from 32 -> 16 bytes.

Add a new PrimitiveHeader concept, which contains all the common
information for a given primitive (such as scroll node, render
task, z value etc).

Instances contain an index to the primitive header, and read the
information from that. This allows the instance size to be
halved. There is a slight extra vertex shader cost, due to
an extra indirection. However, this was not apparent in any
profiling I did, since the vertex shader time typically makes
up a very small amount of overall time. Additionally, the
primitive header texels are likely to be in the texture cache
for each glyph that is fetched. A possible future improvement
is to remove that extra indirection by writing some of that
data, such as the render task address, directly into the primitive
header.

On sites such as nytimes.com or wikipedia.org, where there are
typically a large number of glyphs, this saves several hundred
kB per frame of data being sent to the GPU, which improves the
compositor / driver CPU time.

Also remove the local_clip_chains vector and texture. Now, we just
calculate this as part of the primitive header and include it
there. This can save significant amounts of texture upload on
pages that have a lot of clip chains or clip nodes, relative to
the visible primitive count.

In future, both the PrimitiveHeader and instance structures can
easily be further compressed again, but this can be done as a
follow up.

Finally, although this is a useful optimization by itself, it's
mostly prep work for some changes I have planned related to
how we store and upload scroll nodes. Hopefully these changes will
be both an optimization and make it easier to fix some of the
correctness issues we have with nested 3d transforms.

implement synthetic italics with a skew transform on all platforms

This tries to implement synthetic italics in a way that is compatible with how Gecko does it. That means we no longer use the myriad backend APIs for this, but instead supply skew transforms for the outline that match the transform Gecko is using for metrics.

FreeType requires a bit of extra care in that transforms only apply to outlines and not to bitmaps. So bitmap data must unfortunately be manually transformed to accomplish this.  However, FreeType's own synthetic italics mechanism did not work for bitmaps at all either, so this rewrite was a necessity there anyway. The Windows/Mac backends take care of the bitmap data transforms themselves, so we at least avoid the complexity in those.

Separate primitive shaders from clip shaders

Includes #2622

Note: this is not done because I'm bored.
The problem Szeged team has bumped into is that `aDataX` attributes end up being used in the shaders they don't relate to (e.g. clip shaders). This isn't affecting GLSL but it does affect GLSL -> SPIRV -> XXX shader pipelines.

The solution I came up with involves moving parts of `prim_shared` into separate shared modules, and turning `clip_shared` into a catch-all header of clip shades.

Downsides: more shader modules (but not programs) to navigate between.
Any suggestions on alternative solutions are welcome ;)

ebfee8fdb22f5d0f095687eaa3e7435d5da7714d,servo/webrender,"There's a large number of related changes in this
patch. The overall goal is to make clip chain handling
not depend on screen rectangle generation. This
will make it much easier to implement local space
picture rasterization for perspective elements. In
addition to that, we unify how user / hierarchical and
primitive clip chain nodes are handled.

Clip chain instances are built on demand now, as
required by primitives. Right now, none of the
clip chain information is cached between primitives.
In general, now that the calculations are done in
local space, they are much faster - however we can
easily start to cache the common clip-chain state
(per raster coordinate system) if it ever shows up
in a profile. Additionally, since we only build
clip chains on demand, and clip chains for non-
visible primitives are not built, which is a
decent saving on many pages.

Remove ClipNode altogether. Instead, during flattening
we map directly from a ClipId to a ClipChainId
as appropriate. Clip chains are now created during
flattening and the links remain constant. It's only
during construction of a clip chain instance that we
include and exclude parts of the specified clip
chain. This unifies how we handle user defined clip
chains and legacy hierarchical clip chains. At the
same time, unify how the optional primitive specific
complex clip is handled with clip chains. Now, if
a primitive has a complex clip, it's added as a
normal clip chain node, and linked to the parent
clip chain that this primitive would otherwise
be attached to.

Primitive runs now only depend on the spatial node.
This results in far fewer primitive run breaks.

ClipWorkItems are now stored as a single contiguous
array in the ClipStore. To achieve this they are
stored as an index buffer, and a clip node range
is simply an (index, count). These are a lot
cheaper to pass to clip masks, and also require
fewer heap allocations.

Port hit testing to use the same clip chain data
structures that the main clip code uses, now that
the hierarchical and user defined clip chains are
handled in a uniform way.

Remove the need for Arc in clip chain code, since
clip chains are now stored in a contiguous index
buffer style structure.

This changes brings the WebRender API more into line with the Servo
display list and also the frames generated inside WebRender itself.
Most intermediate display list representations are removed as well as
their place on the resource cache. Perhaps most notably, stacking
contexts are started via a PushStackingContext display item and ended
via a PopStackingContext item. Additionally, the flatten pass has been
significantly simplified to account for these changes.

Use brush_image for blurs, instead of 2d hardware composite.

Once this lands, we can fix drop-shadows by making use of this
functionality, and port the other remaining uses of ps_hardware_composite
to use brush_image. Then, ps_hardware_composite can be removed,
and everything except 3d plane-splits will then be drawn as
normal primitives.

Incidentally, this fixes the way we handle blurs when the source
picture is clipped by either the screen bounds or a clip-chain.
The code will now inflate the rendered portion of the source
render task correctly, so include enough pixels to get a correct
blur result at the edges.

Use glyph metrics to calculate text run bounds and offsets.

Instead of rasterizing glyphs, and using that to calculate the
bounding box of text runs, use glyph metrics instead.

This is important, since it allows us to delay rasterization of
glyphs until later in the frame, which means we can delay the
decision on whether to rasterize a glyph with subpixel
antialising or not.

It also removes the concept of ""user data"" in the texture cache
since the resource cache is now used to extract glyph metrics.

Add a new config directive called NetClass= to CGroup enabled units.
Allowed values are positive numbers for fix assignments and ""auto"" for
picking a free value automatically, for which we need to keep track of
dynamically assigned net class IDs of units. Introduce a hash table for
this, and also record the last ID that was given out, so the allocator
can start its search for the next 'hole' from there. This could
eventually be optimized with something like an irb.

The class IDs up to 65536 are considered reserved and won't be
assigned automatically by systemd. This barrier can be made a config
directive in the future.

Values set in unit files are stored in the CGroupContext of the
unit and considered read-only. The actually assigned number (which
may have been chosen dynamically) is stored in the unit itself and
is guaranteed to remain stable as long as the unit is active.

In the CGroup controller, set the configured CGroup net class to
net_cls.classid. Multiple unit may share the same net class ID,
and those which do are linked together.

Previously, .network files only knew a vaguely defined ""Domains="" concept, for which the documentation declared it was
the ""DNS domain"" for the network connection, without specifying what that means.

With this the Domains setting is reworked, so that there are now ""routing"" domains and ""search"" domains. The former are
to be used by resolved to route DNS request to specific network interfaces, the latter is to be used for searching
single-label hostnames with (in addition to being used for routing). Both settings are configured in the ""Domains=""
setting. Normal domain names listed in it are now considered search domains (for compatibility with existing setups),
while those prefixed with ""~"" are considered routing domains only. To route all lookups to a specific interface the
routing domain ""."" may be used, referring to the root domain. An alternative syntax for this is the ""*"", as was already
implemented before using the ""wildcard"" domain concept.

This commit adds proper parsers for this new logic, and exposes this via the sd-network API. This information is not
used by resolved yet, this will be added in a later commit.

eef85c4a3f8054d29383a176f6cebd1ef3a15b9a,systemd/systemd,"core: track why unit dependencies came to be

This replaces the dependencies Set* objects by Hashmap* objects, where
the key is the depending Unit, and the value is a bitmask encoding why
the specific dependency was created.

The bitmask contains a number of different, defined bits, that indicate
why dependencies exist, for example whether they are created due to
explicitly configured deps in files, by udev rules or implicitly.

Note that memory usage is not increased by this change, even though we
store more information, as we manage to encode the bit mask inside the
value pointer each Hashmap entry contains.

Why this all? When we know how a dependency came to be, we can update
dependencies correctly when a configuration source changes but others
are left unaltered. Specifically:

1. We can fix UDEV_WANTS dependency generation: so far we kept adding
   dependencies configured that way, but if a device lost such a
   dependency we couldn't them again as there was no scheme for removing
   of dependencies in place.

2. We can implement ""pin-pointed"" reload of unit files. If we know what
   dependencies were created as result of configuration in a unit file,
   then we know what to flush out when we want to reload it.

3. It's useful for debugging: ""systemd-analyze dump"" now shows
   this information, helping substantially with understanding how
   systemd's dependency tree came to be the way it came to be.

Add WhileContext class and add plumbing for creating them.

This change introduces WhileContext, which stores information about a
while loop and will be used in future changes to generate while loop
gradient graphs. Exit nodes in a while loop now have a pointer to
their associated WhileContext. This will be used to retrieve the
context for a given loop.

This change adds an optional parameter to BuildWhileLoop() to create a
WhileContext for the while loop (currently this is always true, but
gradients will generate while loops without associated contexts). This
change also adds a as-yet-unused option to BuildWhileLoop() to return
the predicate output.

Add an automatically-generated ""tensorflow.python.platform.build_info"" script.

The motivation for this script is to provide better tools for
diagnosing load-time errors (such as the ones that plague the Windows
build due to DLL issues). Note that the script is intended to be
self-contained, so that it is possible to import it without loading
the entire TensorFlow runtime.

This generated script currently contains a single symbol,
`is_cuda_build`, which records whether the build has GPU support or not.

FirstReadyManager for scheduling nodes in VirtualScheduler.
The current FIFOManager may yield inefficient scheduling; _Recv pushed to the
FIFO blocks other nodes that can run before _Recv due to the node order in FIFO.
FirstReadyManager picks a node with the earliest time_ready in the queue,
avoiding this problem.

Also, fixed VirtualPlacer to properly set device when Node's device name does not
include job name and to set GPU:0 as default device.

This change introduces a new `DatasetWrapper` type that wraps a

ops now consume and produce DT_VARIANT instead of DT_RESOURCE, and the
underlying implementation is simplified because the `DatasetWrapper`
can be passed directly by value without using the `ResourceMgr`.

Fix signed int overflow issue in tensor_id.cc

When a node name has a long numeric suffix, e.g.,
""foo/y_0/gradient_debug_09684b60f2184c67b744721915034528"" (as has happened with tfdbg GradientsDebugger),

the parsing algorithm in ParseTensorName() may experience signed int overflow. Replacing the types with ""unsigned int"" resolves the issue.

 - Remote execution/caching and BES share flags for authentication and TLS.
 - Removed API Key authentication from BES, as it's not being used.
 - Add TLS support to BES upload.
 - Add --bes_project_id flag. If set, the value is propagated as part of BES

000494327d4efab63362f3a940db74ffa8b9d712,bazelbuild/bazel,"Implement the core structure for dynamic configurations.

This is a big change, so let me walk you through the key pieces:

1) This cl provides an alternative mechanism for creating configurations and doing configuration transitions that's ""dynamic"" in that the configurations can be created on the fly and the transitions are arbitrary mappings from BuildOptions --> BuildOptions that can also be created on the fly. It also integrates this with ConfiguredTargetFunction, so the configured target graph automatically uses this framework.

2) It does *not* replace old-style (which we'll call ""static"") configurations. For a number of important reasons: It's not yet at feature parity (particularly: no LIPO). It's not remotely tested across real projects enough to have confidence that it's battle-ready. It doesn't yet handle certain ""special"" functions like BuildConfiguration.prepareToBuild() and BuildConfiguration.getRoots(). It still relies on the old static transition logic to determine what transitions to apply (eventually we'll distribute that logic out, but that's too much for a single cl). We need the option to toggle it on and off until we have enough confidence in it. So with this cl, builds can be done in either mode.

3) The new flag --experimental_dynamic_configs toggles use of dynamic configurations.

4) Dynamic configurations are created with the Skyframe function BuildConfigurationFunction (this was already created in an earlier change). This consumes a BuildOptions and a set of configuration fragments to produce a BuildConfiguration.

5) Dynamic transitions are instances of the new class PatchTransition, which simply maps an input BuildOptions to an output BuildOptions.

6) Since static and dynamic configurations have to co-exist (for now), this cl tries hard to keep today's transition logic defined in a single place (vs. forking a dedicated copy for each configuration style). This is done via the new interface BuildConfiguration.TransitionApplier. BuildConfiguration.evaluateTransition is modified to feed its transition logic into TransitionApplier's common API. Both dynamic and static configurations have their own implementations that ""do the right thing"" with the results.

7) The transition applier for dynamic configurations basically stores the Transition, then allows DependencyResolver (which calls BuildConfiguration.evaluateTransition) to return Dependency instances containing that Transition (vs. a BuildConfiguration, which they traditionally contain).

7.5) An earlier variation of the dynamic transition applier retained BuildOptions (e.g. when it got a Transition it immediately applied it to get its output BuildOptions, then stored that). This had the advantage of making composing of transitions easier, especially within BuildConfiguration.evaluateTransition (which can theoretically apply multiple transitions to the input configuration). But it turns out that applying transitions has a cost, and it's simply more performant to pass them through until they're really needed.

8) In dynamic configuration mode, after ConfiguredTargetFunction gets its deps (e.g. an <Attribute, Dependency> multimap), it ""trims"" the configurations for its dependencies by a) only including config fragments required by the deps' subtrees and b) applying the transitions that came from 7). This all happens in the new method ConfiguredTargetFunction.trimConfigurations.

9) trimConfigurations is heavily performance-optimized based on a lot of experience running this through a large project within Google. As it turns out, the cost of host transitions can be atrocious (because there are a lot of them). Also, BuildOptions.clone() is expensive. And just creating BuildConfiguration SkyKeys also has a cost (largely because of BuildOptions cloning), so that shouldn't be done except when really necessary. My experience with this convinced me it's worth making this method complicated for the sake of making it fast. Since it basically visits every edge in the configured target graph (at least), it really needs to be slick.

10) Since host transitions in particular are problematic w.r.t. speed, I compute the host *once* in ConfigurationCollectionFunction.getHostConfiguration() and expose that reference to ConfiguredTargetFunction and other Skyframe functions. This limits recomputation to just when the fragments are trimmed.

11) Since options cloning is expensive, I'm doing something scary: exposing a BuildConfiguration.getOptions() method that returns a direct reference. Since BuildOptions is mutable, this is dangerous in the wrong hands. I can experiment with going back to cloning (with the caching of host transitions it may not matter as much), but we may ultimately have to put up with this risk for the sake of performant analysis time. What would be *really* awesome would be to make BuildOptions immutable. But that's not going to happen in this cl.

So in short, the key abstractions in this cl are:
 - PatchTransition
 - BuildConfiguration.TransitionApplier
 - ConfiguredTargetFunction.trimConfigurations

The current implementation imposes no analysis time penalty

922d1e671bc02086afdcfb8ae1636eefc53e0ee2,bazelbuild/bazel,"remote: Add interceptor for logging gRPC calls during remote execution/caching

This provides a io.grpc.ClientInterceptor implementation that can be used to log gRPC call information. The interceptor can select a logging handler to use based on the gRPC method being called (Watch, Execute, Write, etc) to build a LogEntry, which can then be logged after the call has finished. Unit tests for the interceptor are included.

In this change, the interceptor is never invoked, nor are there any handlers implemented for any gRPC methods. The interceptor also never tries to log any entries.

To avoid circular dependency issues (Remote library will depend on logger which depends on remote library for utils), I've factored out the utility classes from the remote library into their own directory/package as part of this change.

- The number of stat() syscalls in the SymlinkedSandboxedSpawn was way too high. Do less, feel better.

- When using --experimental_sandbox_base, ensure that symlinks in the path are resolved. Before this, you had to check whether on your system /dev/shm is a symlink to /run/shm and then use that instead. Now it no longer matters, as symlinks are resolved.

- Remove an unnecessary directory creation from each sandboxed invocation. Turns out that the ""tmpdir"" that we created was no longer used after some changes to Bazel's TMPDIR handling.

- Use simpler sandbox paths, by using the unique ID for each Spawn provided by SpawnExecutionPolicy instead of a randomly generated temp folder name. This also saves a round-trip from our VFS to NIO and back. Clean up the sandbox base before each build to ensure that the unique IDs are actually unique. ;)

- Use Java 8's Process#isAlive to check whether a process is alive instead of trying to get the exitcode and catching an exception.

Closes #4913.

Do not give up immediately if renaming/moving the
install base directory fails, wait and retry
instead.

This is necessary because on Windows the directory
we just created and populated with the extracted

antivirus, so there are open file handles in it so
it cannot be renamed. This new logic ensures the
AV has enough time to scan all files, close the
handles, letting us successfully rename the
directory.

This change adds an is_active flag and mode (with default being ""honor"").
The commit is only as large as it is because many parts of the codebase were
manipulating enrollments by adding and removing CourseEnrollment objects
directly. It was necessary to create classmethods on CourseEnrollment to
encapsulate this functionality and then port everything over to using them.

The migration to add columns has been tested on a prod replica, and seems to be
fine for running on a live system with single digit millions of rows of

instead of the constant-rgx regular expression, and it doesn't match, so it
throws an error. Not sure how to fix pylint, so we'll just ignore these errors.

d0285562632c329f45cc1cf65eae71f9532d3613,openstack/cinder,"Implement QoS support for volumes

This patch is to implement generic Quality-of-Service(QoS) support for volumes.
The goal is to add an interface so that cloud/Cinder admins can use to set
volume QoS, which can be enforced either in hypervisor or on Cinder back-end
or both. QoS specifications are added as a standalone (only visible to admin)
entity.  So admin can create/update/delete and associate/disassociate QoS
specifications to other entities, in this case volume types.

Note that while it's possible for Cinder to set the granularity of QoS control
to every single volume, this patch puts the control granularity to the level
of volumes of the same type to minimize the impact of other Cinder parts.
In other words, the design is to bond QoS with volume types. So Cinder admin
can associate volume types with QoS specifications, and volumes of same volume
type share the same QoS specifications.

QoS can mean a lot different things that it's unlikely we can come up with a
interpretation that all vendors can agree on.  So the approach this
implementation takes is to make Quality-of-Service specs as free-from, i.e.
expressed as key/value pairs.

Changes:
 - Add a quality_of_service_specs table, using adjacency list relation to store
 a specs entry and its detailed specs in key/values. Note that to be able to
 distinguish where should the QoS specs be consumed, each QoS specs entity
 will have a 'consumer' (i.e. fixed key) with the value of where admin would
 like the QoS policy to be enforced/consumed, currently these three values are
 considered valid: 'front-end' (Nova Compute), 'back-end' (Cinder back-end),
 'both'. The default value for 'consumer' is 'back-end';
 - Add a new API extension 'qos_specs_manage' to allow list/create/update/
 delete/associate/disassociate of QoS specs;
 - Add volume/qos_specs internal API for qos specs manipulation;
 - Add 'qos_specs' info to data structure when
 initialize_connection() is called.
 - Add 'qos_specs' to request_specs and filter properties for
 a volume create request.

 TODO
 - Modify 'type_manage' API extension to be able to accept qos info.
 - Modify volume_types.create() to accept qos info and do the checks.

8aac388cc091b6c79c2d0650810acf72a1097446,openstack/cinder,"Move volume_clear and clear_size opts up to driver

The block_device driver pulled in the clear and clear_size
options for it's own use and broke the inheritance model needed
for multiple backend configs.

This change moves the two configs up higher in the heirarchy to
driver.py so that it can be shared/used by all drivers if they desire.

This means that they are now set properly in volume_opts.  At some
point we shoudl restructure this a bit to allow multi-backends to
specify independent settings for these configs.

d99fb6011cc610b78d42891800189feed0391742,openstack/cinder,"Implement ability to Clone volumes in Cinder.

This implements the capability to create usable volume clones in Cinder,
for the LVM case we create a temporary snapshot to copy from so that
volumes can remain attached during cloning.  This works by passing
in a source-volume-id to the create command (similar to create-from-snapshot).

Currently we limit clone to the same Cinder node, and only for the base LVM driver.
All other drivers should raise NotImplemented, most inherit from the SANISCSIDriver,
so move the function there and raise until we have a general implementation
for SANISCSI based drivers.

Those drivers that inherit from ISCSI directly instead of SANISCSI,
add the function explicitly and raise NotImplementedError there as well.

809567661d6732eaf4a5e77d2f2df07621ee5114,openstack/cinder,"Fix volume lookups in SolidFire template caching

There's a number of issues with the SolidFire template caching
code.  There are a number of metadata items that aren't consistent
between Glance API V1 and V2, there's also some problems with how
the code is dealing with it's internal volume and just flat out
wrong account checking.

This patch focuses mainly on fixing up the account and volumeID
issues.  The _do_clone method currently expects to find the src
volume under the same account as the dest volume.  That's fine
for most cases, but doesn't work for either the SolidFire template
caching, or for the use of generic image caching in Cinder.

We fix that easily by modifying the _get_sf_volume call to have an
option to search all active volumes on the Cluster instead of just
those for a specified account.  For now we only change the clone
methods, as they're the only case where we fall into the case of
cross-ownership of volumes in the same context.

The other issue is around the cleanup/delete in the case of a
failed template-volume create.  In this case we were passing in
the Cinder UUID to a direct SolidFire API delete cmd, which
is wrong.  The direct call for the SolidFire API call requires
that the actual SolidFire ID be used.  So we leverage the modified
_get_sf_volume call here as well.

Another issue that was introduced was the introduction of
a connector object to the intialize_connection call.  We
got around this once already by just passing in a fake
connector that was actually a string.  That was fine, but
the initialize_connection routine also now checks the connector
for multi_attach, so it fails the _get call on a string.  We
fix that by just building a dict and using that instead of
a fake string.

Finally, the method of relying on the Glance metadata virt size
has been problematic, it's not set by default, it's not accurate
and it's a bit inefficient.  There have been a number of issues
with this method of size determination, so we'll dump that and
just leverage the image_utils methods directly.

ca97a7461f0f56835a0f2dceb9afaebac756f7c3,openstack/cinder,"Enhance iSCSI multipath support

Currently, nova-compute and brick support multipath for iSCSI volume
data path. It depends on response to targets discovery of the main
iSCSI portal, expecting multiple portal addresses to be contained.

However, some arrays only respond to discovery with a single portal
address, even if secondary portals are available. In this case,
the connector cannot know secondary portals and corresponding
iSCSI target IQN, so cannot establish multiple sessions for
the target(s). To enable the connector to login to secondary portals,
cinder should tell all the portal addresses and corresponding
target iqns/luns.

With this patch initialize_connection API will return connection_info
with multiple portal addresses/iqns/luns when multipath=True is
specified in the connector info. For example:

  {""driver_volume_type"": ""iscsi"",
   ""data"": {""target_portals"": [""10.0.2.15:3260"", ""10.0.3.15:3260""],
            ""target_iqns"": [""iqn.2010-10.org.example:target-01"",
                            ""iqn.2010-10.org.example:target-02""],
            ""target_luns"": [1, 2],
            ...}}

This also modify brick/iscsi/connector.py to make the parameter
recognized and to login to every target.

In addition, this adds an config option
'iscsi_secondary_ip_addresses' to specify a list of secondary
portal addresses for LVM iSCSI Driver.

f586043fa969b9d1dcf4933aacbf615f53691093,openstack/cinder,"Add support for file I/O volume migration

This patch changes the generic volume migration logic to support
non-attachable volumes.  Non-attachable refers to volume drivers that do
not support attachment via the typical iSCSI or similar protocols where
a block device is made available on the host machine.  Device drivers
such as RBD make volumes available to cinder via a file handle that
proxies read() and write() calls to the Ceph cluster.

This patch improves the generic migration logic to determine whether a
migration operation can proceed with dd using block device paths or file
operations on handles returned from the os-brick connectors.

Changes to the RBD driver are included to correctly rename the target
volume during the completion phase of a successful migration.

It appears there is still some work to be done for attached in-use
volume migration for certain configurations.  Successful tests were seen
for:

  LVM to LVM (available and in-use)
  LVM to/from NFS (available and in-use)
  LVM to/from Ceph (available)
  Ceph to LVM (in-use)
  NFS to/from Ceph (available)
  Ceph to NFS (in-use)

Failures were seen (due to Nova) for the following:

  LVM to Ceph (in-use)
  NFS to Ceph (in-use)

504b466295f3d97307216095f450ff8421796319,openstack/cinder,"Remove remotable from OVOs

In Cinder we don't have an indirection service to forward object methods
like Nova does (Conductor) so we shouldn't be defining all methods as
remotable since they are not.

If we ever decide to have a Conductor we can easily add them back where
appropriate, but for now they are only a hindrance:

- It's confusing, because most people don't understand what it actually
  means in Cinder and they just add it to the methods because they see
  it in other OVO methods.
- Every time we change a remote method's signature or add a new remote
  method to an object the hash of that object changes and we need to
  update our test_versions test, which is not necessary.
- This makes the linking of VOs with their list counterparts
  problematic, because everyone will need to know that there is no need
  to bump the version of a list object whenever they add or modify a
  remotable method.
- We are executing unnecessary code with decorators, even if it's not
  much, it's still wasted CPU time .

This patch removes all appearances of remotable and remotable_class
decorators thus making our OVOs consistent with our implementation and
removing the need of updating our tests on unrelated OVO changes.

Previously resource handling was broken in a few ways:
1. Resources targets in the same build file could not be addressed
   via `PythonTarget.resources` because relative_to was not passed to

2. Since resource targets were not modelled as dependencies, they
   could not be found via the `PythonTarget.resources` property since
   they never were loaded into the build graph.
3. SetupPy only honored resources set via the `PythonTarget`
   `resources` constructor parameter.

This change fixes resources to be modelled as dependencies like they
are for `JvmTarget`, solving 2 above, and fixes resources target
resolution to use `relative_to` solving 1 above.  `SetupPy` now reads
resources from the fixed `PythonTarget.resources` property and gathers
resource sources like it does for all other dependencies fixing 3
above.

All existing python targets are updated to use `target_resources`
instead of `resources` as dogfood and a unit test is added to ensure
both modes of expressing resources work.

DetectDuplicates, DxCompile and JarTask all make distinctions in their
processing between internal classpath elements and external ones.
Although DxCompile was handled in 2d515b55, DetectDuplicates and
JarTask were not.  This change fixes the latter two and makes the
handling of the former uniform via a new `ClasspathUtil` helper method
that can return the `internal_classpath`.

The `DuplicateDetectorTest` is re-vamped to cover duplicates between
jars, between internal targets and across both types of targets to
exercise the case that triggered
https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/2358.

The `BinaryCreateIntegrationTest.test_deploy_excludes` is unmarked fail
as a result of the `JarTask` fix and now successfully tests the case
that triggered https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/2359.

In the course of adding `ClasspathUtil.internal_classpath`,
`ClasspathUtil.compute_classpath` is removed since it was only called
by `ClasspathUtilTest`.  That test is fixed to exercise the production
codepath used by `JvmCompile`,
`ClasspathUtil.compute_classpath_for_target`.  The unused
`target_closure` is also removed from that method as well as from its
call chain through `JvmCompile`.

1dda3a05a832569ea6a5ed9ff5056947ab181b99,pantsbuild/pants,"Reimplement the jvm tool registration mechanism via the options system.

Instead of reaching in to config directly, the tool registration simply
registers an appropriately-named option, and then registers the fact
that this option is in fact a jvm tool.

The option value is a list of specs. We set sensible defaults in the code,
which are specs in a root-level BUILD.tools file.

There's one slight quirk, which is that we must the register function into
our calls to register_jvm_tool(). This is because the JvmToolTaskMixin can't
have its own register_options() method (because it comes after TaskBase
in the mro, and chained super-calls to register_options() stop at TaskBase).

NOTE: This is a larger change that I would have liked, but it's pretty easy to review, as almost every file it touches is made simpler.

Testing Done:
CI passed other than one unrelated unittest failure. Another one baking, just in case.
Doing some ongoing manual testing to see that options work.

e1c1a18a7980d63fc439a1b6b96b51214476baad,pculture/unisubs,"Refactored action code

Split perform() into several parts:
  - validate() handles the validation part
  - update_language() handles updating the SubtitleLanguage in
    add_subtitles().
  - perform() handles the stuff that used to be done in do_perform().

The main improvement is that perform() isn't called until after the
add_subtitles() transaction is committed, which seems more correct.
For example if we want to try to send a ping to some external service
we shouldn't do it until we have actually saved the data in the DB.

I also think that the code is a bit simpler now.  Calling the function
do_perform() was a bit awkward.  Also we don't need the send_signals()
function anymore, we can move that code into perform().

I think the tasks code should still work.  One difference is that the
code that was in do_perform() is being called later on, after the
subtitles are saved.  However, this is basically the same process as
saving a draft, then clicking the Complete/Approve/Send Back button
without any extra changes.

Added template tag to include a media bundle.  It doesn't support S3
yet.

Changed the URL conf for our media urls.  Now bundles are put into
the css/js subdirectories, which mimics the old structure.  Also we
now serve up the images and fonts directory in the urlconf.  This is
needed for our CSS relative paths to work (for example
url(../images/amara-logo.png)).

Removed a bunch of things that we no longer use/need:
  - pagedemo app
  - The unisubs-stat js file (It wasn't used by any of our apps, but
    it got built and uploaded to
    http://s3.www.universalsubtitles.org/js/unisubs-statwidget.js)
  - The test_form page (/videos/test)
  - The jstesting app (bunch of pages that start with /jstesting/)
  - The streamer app (bunch of pages that start with /streamer/)

Removed some javascript calls to the closure code:
  - unisubs.widget.WidgetController.makeGeneralSettings.  I think this
    is no longer needed with the new embedder.
  - unisubs.messaging.simplemessage.displayPendingMessages.  I don't
    think we use the simplemessage framework anymore.

No longer include unisubs-onsite-compiled.js I think this was only
needed for the old widget and we don't use that on our site anymore.
We were also sometimes using offsite-compiled for our own pages which
seems strange.

Added a semicolon at the end of jquery.chosen.min.js.  I guess it left
it out to save the byte, but this doesn't work when we combine
javascript files together.

Still to do:
  - new editor JS
  - embedder (both JS and CSS)
  - old embedder
  - widgitizer

- NormalWorkflowController handles normal mode -- the same as the old

- ReviewWorkflowController handles review mode

Added some HTML for review mode.  Split up workflow.html into 2 files

Made the video/help section not use WorkflowProgressionController.

- For help we didn't need it at all, because we setup $scope.workflow
  in the AppController
- For video we just needed to move the code that handles the overlay.
  Also renamed same variables that had to do the the subtitle overlay

  showSubtitle (previously showOverlay) to hide the subtitles when
  there isn't an active one.

Fixed issues with display show page and epCat key errors.

Fixed duplicate log messages for clearing provider caches.

Fixed issues with email notifier ep names not properly being encoded to UTF-8.

TVDB<->TVRAGE Indexer ID mapping is now performed on demand to be used when needed such as newznab providers can be searched with tvrage_id's and some will return tvrage_id's that later can be used to create show objects from for faster and more accurate name parsing, mapping is done via Trakt API calls.

Added stop event signals to schedualed tasks, SR now waits indefinate till task has been fully stopped before completing a restart or shutdown event.

NameParserCache is now persistent and stores 200 parsed results at any given time for quicker lookups and better performance, this helps maintain results between updates or shutdown/startup events.

Black and White lists for anime now only get used for anime shows as intended, performance gain for non-anime shows that dont need to load these lists.

Internal name cache now builds it self on demand when needed per show request plus checks if show is already in cache and if true exits routine to save time.

Schedualer and QueueItems classes are now a sub-class of threading.Thread and a stop threading event signal has been added to each.

If I forgot to list something it doesn't mean its not fixed so please test and report back if anything is wrong or has been corrected by this new release.

f862c694c5a77d227b91692dbcc22f07d478327c,alphagov/rummager,"Simplify checking fields in parameter parser

Remove the hardcoded list of ""ALLOWED_FILTER_FIELDS"" in favour of
allowing any field which has a defined filter type to be used for
filtering.  This increases the number of fields which can be filtered on
considerably, but I'm happy with this since filtering imposes little
overhead in elasticsearch, so if callers want to do that we should let
them.

It also removes the restriction that fields which are defined for only a
few document types (such as finders) can only be filtered on if a
document_type restriction is added.  This was only ever done because it
was the easiest thing to implement, and removing it makes the code much
cleaner and easier to document.

""document_type"" needs to be added as a special case for the list of
allowed filter fields, since it's actually an alias for the internal
""_type"" field, and therefore doesn't appear in the schema.

As part of this, SearchParameterParser now needs to be given a
CombinedIndexSchema for the indexes which are being searched on;
previously, it was being given an `Index` object for the 'mainstream'
index, which was used to get the schema for the ""finder"" document types,
for allowing extra filter fields when filtering by `document_type`.

86fc11d0c9b799f916d69ced72dc8a26a07591a2,coreboot/coreboot,"arm/arm64: Generalize bootblock C entry point

When we first added ARM support to coreboot, it was clear that the
bootblock would need to do vastly different tasks than on x86, so we
moved its main logic under arch/. Now that we have several more
architectures, it turns out (as with so many things lately) that x86 is
really the odd one out, and all the others are trying to do pretty much
the same thing. This has already caused maintenance issues as the ARM32
bootblock developed and less-mature architectures were left behind with
old cruft.

This patch tries to address that problem by centralizing that logic
under lib/ for use by all architectures/SoCs that don't explicitly
opt-out (with the slightly adapted existing BOOTBLOCK_CUSTOM option).
This works great out of the box for ARM32 and ARM64. It could probably
be easily applied to MIPS and RISCV as well, but I don't have any of
those boards to test so I'll mark them as BOOTBLOCK_CUSTOM for now and
leave that for later cleanup.

d7be10284b883fe8fc8f46cfa2a2999eaffe1b5c,git-cola/git-cola,"cola: add support for diff.tool

Now that difftool uses diff.tool instead of merge.tool
we teach cola to use merge.tool.

This also removes all usage of the --tool=<tool> parameter
to git-mergetool and git-difftool since the assumption is
that users will use the appropriate diff/merge.tool config variable.

We were checking for the presence of the ""lfs"" object store as evidence
of ""git lfs"" being initialized, but it falsely identifies repositories
as having git lfs installed even after running ""git lfs uninstall"".

Make the LFS detection more robust by checking for the presence of the
lfs filter configuration and a ""git lfs install""-provided hook.  These
are both removed by ""git lfs uninstall"".

Update snippets UI

## What does this MR do?

Updates snippets UI _(mainly mobile view)_ to new UI proposed in #18849.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Does anyone know the implementation difference between `app/views/snippets/show.html.haml` and `app/views/projects/snippets/show.html.haml`? I have only been updating the latter as it's the only one I can find implemented. I assume the former is rendered somewhere seeing as there is controllers for it too. But this doesn't seem very DRY from my current perspective.

Refactor Ci::Commit and Ci::Build to have all builds for same :sha on single page

This makes Ci::Commit to have only :sha and simplifies routing to have only :sha in path. The :ref and :push_data is now parameter of Ci::Build.

All commit related data (git author, message and .gitlab-ci.yml) is read directly from repository.

All code related for creating builds is moved to CreateBuildsService.

Status deduction is rewritten to make if more efficient and easier to integrate with Commit Status API.

This is partially working, tests are not yet touched.

This slightly changes view of Commit:

Re-implement page-specific JS in a better way.

## What does this MR do?

This rebuilds the way we do page-specific JavaScript assets for a few reasons:

- The current implementation does not work with Subresource Integrity (!4808)
- The current implementation doesn't allow caching of libraries because each page we hook up with this system will have a separate application.js. Meaning that for every page that uses Ace Editor, we'd have to load Ace Editor plus any GitLab-specific scripts in the same file, making local caching of just Ace Editor impossible.
- The current implementation is rather hacky.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

That Sprockets doesn't choke on this when we use precompiled assets.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

#14372

## Does this MR meet the acceptance criteria?

Make namespace API available to all users

### What does this MR do?

This MR makes it possible for a user to query namespaces to which he/she has access. Also, it adds documentation for the existing API.

### Why was this MR needed?

Even though the `groups` API exists, it might still be useful to have an endpoint that tells the namespace type (e.g. `user` vs. `group`), especially if a user has access to a number of different projects.

### What are the relevant issue numbers?

Closes https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/issues/9328

e805a6470031d942f7de604fdf7acfc7cf4f0b1a,gitlabhq/gitlabhq,"Backport changes from gitlab-org/gitlab-ee!581 to CE.

!581 has a lot of changes that would cause merge conflicts if not
properly backported to CE. This commit/MR serves as a better
foundation for gitlab-org/gitlab-ee!581.

= Changes =

1. Move from `has_one {merge,push}_access_level` to `has_many`, with the
   `length` of the association limited to `1`. This is _effectively_ a
   `has_one` association, but should cause less conflicts with EE, which
   is set to `has_many`. This has a number of related changes in the
   views, specs, and factories.

2. Make `gon` variable loading more consistent (with EE!581) in the
   `ProtectedBranchesController`. Also use `::` to prefix the
   `ProtectedBranches` services, because this is required in EE.

3. Extract a `ProtectedBranchAccess` concern from the two access level
   models. This concern only has a single `humanize` method here, but
   will have more methods in EE.

4. Add `form_errors` to the protected branches creation form. This is
   not strictly required for EE compatibility, but was an oversight
   nonetheless.

1. `GitPushService` was still using `{merge,push}_access_level_attributes` instead

2. The branches API creates access levels regardless of the state of the
   `developers_can_{push,merge}` parameters. This is in line with the UI,
   where Master access is the default for a new protected branch.

3. Use `after(:build)` to create access levels in the
   `protected_branches` factory, so that `factories_spec` passes. It
   only builds records, so we need to create access levels on `build` as

Use badge image template instead of using separate images

## What does this MR do?

Makes it possible to use template for badge instead of having multiple files.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

We also have a deprecated badge in `controllers/ci/projects_controller.rb`.  We decided to leave it until 9.0, so we still have images in `public/ci/` until 9.0.

## Why was this MR needed?

We are going to implement build coverage badge, and we do not want to store 101 SVG images for each percentage value.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

#3714

The function for renaming hosts in WATO is now available in a new bulk
mode. This is a new button in each folder, where you can recursively rename
hosts in a generic way. There are several types of renamings that can be done:

LI:case translation into lower or upper case
LI:adding and removing suffixes
LI:adding prefixes
LI:regular expression operations (much like <tt>sed</tt>)
LI:explicit mappings

For each affected site only <b>one</b> restart of the site is needed. This
can speed up renaming operations with lots of hosts drastically when compared
to renaming each host apart.

2a283cddc1679bddcfa81a00c7a479fcf61cbfee,huiyiqun/check_mk,"Refactored visual code again

The ""context_type""-concept was not fitting all needs, for example
a single host visual showing multiple services could not be filtered
by details of the services.  We decided to recode this feature again
to slightly simplify the mechanism again and make all features usable
again.

To the users which already used the dasboard designer or created custom
views with the git builds since introducion of the ""context type""
feature will need to perform some migrations by hand.

You will either need to remove all your custom views and dashboards
from var/check_mk/web/*/user_dashboards.mk and
var/check_mk/web/*/user_views.mk. Or you try to migrate the defined
views and dashboards in this file. For this you will need to remove
the attribute ""context_type"" from views and dashboards and replace
it with the new ""single_infos"" attribute.
The ""single_infos"" attribute contains a list of strings which each
references a info type which should be identified by specific attributes
like the hostname to get a single object of that type.
For example replace the definition ""context_type"": ""host"" with
""single_infos"": ['host'] in case of e.g. a view which only shows data
about one single host.

8a4e919b50a09238034005bdbd642b3903de6593,huiyiqun/check_mk,"Fix Windows eventlog output with vista_api=yes

The Vista API uses the Win API function EvtFormatMessage that delivers
formatted strings with trailing null characters within the allocated
wstring buffer size. Until the refactoring done in
df323514929740597f21db7c03460cf3ff28515e, this did not cause trouble as
the wstring to UTF8 conversion was done using the Win API and 'old' C
strings. The refactoring introduced C++ standard library conversion that
is done on wstring objects instead of C strings. As a consequence, the
trailing null character was taken into the formatted message, later
causing the socket output to be cut at it. The fix is to trim possible
trailing null characters away from the formatted eventlog message.

This moves the floating IP port creation outside of the transaction
that creates the floating IP record. This eliminates the use of one
of the GUARD_TRANSACTION flags to prepare us for the enginefacade
switch and correct event notification semantics for push
notifications.

Note that this introduces a small window where the server can die
mid-process and leave an orphaned port without a floating IP. This
is similar to what can happen for router gateway ports. The intention
is to address these in a follow-up patch with a periodic garbage
collection task that will look for floating IP ports with a device
ID of 'PENDING' since the tenant cannot delete them on their own.

  WORMTables (not implemented - but pretty straightforward)
    these tables can support a fixed 'table' (meaning not-appendable), that is searchable via queries
    this would have greatly enhanced write performance compared with AppendableTables, and a similar read performance profile

  In addition, the tables allow for arbitrary axes to be indexed (e.g. you could save a panel that allows indexing on major_axis,minor_axis AND items),
    so all dimensions are queryable (currently only major/minor axes allow this query)

  all tests pass (with 1 exception)

- changed iohub_keyboard and iohub_mouse basic demo's to have a time out
of 15 sec of no event activity. Added extra text indicating what to do
and how to exit each as well.

- Added note to custom install guide re: gevent 1.0 + required.

- Added getHubServerConfig() method to ioHub connection

- Optimized device event listener _handleEvent() code.

- Fixed support for ESC out of calibration routine for Tobii eye
tracker.

- Windows OS: Fixed issue with mouse events not being allowed outside of
psychopy full screen window even when this constraint was not specified
in user script.

- Removed extra '\\n\\r' from end of all iobub msg requests and
responses. No longer needed since msgpack is sole encoding/compression
source.

- Added forced greenlet yield to next greenlet even if current greenlet
is polled and poll duration >= polling interval. Will make no difference
on fast computers but may make iohub Server more responsive on slower
computers.

- Added logic in variableProvider class which determines longest string
in all possible values for a string condition variable and uses that as
the max str length for the trial condition table in the ioDataStore hdf5
file.

* Add a new method to be called when the contents of the workspace change and
the scrollbars need to be adjusted but the the chrome (trash, toolbox, etc)
are expected to stay in the same place.

Change a bunch of calls to svgResize to either be removed or call the new
method instead.  This is a nice performance win since the offsetHeight/Width
call in svgResize can be expensive, especially when called as often as we do -
there was some layout thrashing.

This also paves the way for moving calls to recordDeleteAreas
(which is also expensive) to a more cacheable spot than on every
mouse down/touch event.

of things (namely the scrollbars)

* Fix size of graph demo when it first loads by calling svgResize.
The graph starts with fixed width and was relying on a resize event
to fire (which I believe was removed in commit
217c681b86b0f2df76c479c9efae62e6e).

* Fix the resizing of the code demo.  The demo's tab min-width used to
match the toolbox's width was only being set on a resize event, but
commit 217c681b86b0f2df76c479c9efae62e6e changed how that worked.

* Fix up some comments.

* Use specific workspaces rather than Blockly.getMainWorkspace().

* Make workspace required for resizeSvgContents and update
some calls to send real workspaces rather than ones that are
null.

Remove the private tag on terminateDrag_ because it is only
actually called from outside the BlockSvg object.

* Remove a rogue period.

* Recategorize BlockSvg.terminateDrag_ to @package instead of @private so that
other developers don't use it, but it still can be used by other Blockly classes.

* Add indexing setting for JavaScript Generation (#419)

Adding setting to allow for switching between zero and one based indexing for Blockly Blocks such that the generated code will use this flag to determine whether one based or zero based indexing should be used. One based indexing is enabled by default.

* cache delete areas instead of recalculating them onMouseDown

* Cache screen CTM for performance improvement.

* Call svgResizeContents from block_svg's dipose so that deleting blocks (#434)

from the context menu (or anywhere really) causes the workspace to
recalculate its size.
Remove the call to svgResizeContents from onMouseUp's logic for
determining whether the block is being dropped in the trash
since it calls dispose.

One side effect of this is that when you delete multiple blocks
resize gets called for each of them and the scrollbars move during
the operation. This is most obviously seen by doing an airstrike
in the playground and then deleting all the blocks at once.

* Allow terminal blocks to replace other terminal blocks (#433)

The general idea is that AMP can be instructed to not block the UI thread during load phase for long if the document itself is not visible.

The change may be quite impactful. It does split up work into neat chunks (about 10-20ms on desktop, longer on mobile) instead of one 400ms+ block. I validated that the number of style recalc doesn't change when the experiment is off.

- Current doesn't change `amp-shadow`. That will come in a follow up CL, but might not make as much sense.
- With the experiment not active the only thing this should change is that the initialization now goes through a bunch of micro tasks. This should behave as before in browsers with native promises.

675d094da8886d92099574ca6353d1f3aca9ba0c,hyperledger/fabric,"[FAB-1367] Rebase Kafka on common components

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1367

This is the changeset that ties together all the previous changesets in
this series: it rebases the Kafka consenter on the components that are
meant to be common across all consensus implementations. The major
addition here is the new logic which resides in ""main.go"" in the kafka
package.

On top of the existing unit tests for the Kafka consenter's
sub-components (producer, consumer, broker), this changeset introduces
some basic unit tests for the new logic, identical to the ones for the
solo package. More tests are needed however, and we are in the process of
writing BDD feature files for that purpose - see
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1335 for more.

This changeset also adds the following:

1. A ""disk"" (a channel for passing messages) to the mock Consumer. The
mock Consumer will use that ""disk"" to fetch the replies that it returns
during the Recv() call. This is required for the units tests we
introduced, where we want the (mock) consumer to respond with the
messages that the (mock) producer posted. The two mock constructs use
this disk channel to communicate, simulating a consumer that reads the
messages that a producer posted to a partition.
2. A timeout to the mock consumer's Recv() method to prevent blocking in
for/select loops.

Finally, this changeset makes the following refactoring-related changes:

1. It establishes a common path for both solo and the kafka consenters in
the orderer package's ""main.go"" - the previous version of this file was
whipped up together quickly and was essentially a giant if-else
construct. As we get closer to a release, some refactoring was in order.
2. It makes all dependencies in the kafka package explicit. In the
previous version, we would pass around the entire config object to
functions and let them pick what they needed from it. While this made for
symmetric and simple-looking function signatures, it allowed for
ambiguous and implicit dependencies, and would increase confusion and
maintenance burden. This specific edit affects almost all files in the
kafka package and makes for a bigger diff than necessary. I had
unfortunately began working on this before beginning the 'rebasing on
common components' work, and proceeded with both tasks in parallel. (In
hindsight, I should have scheduled this a bit better.)

f5e25a3d26e26be2a929eb8099e9a9bc4ecb8154,hyperledger/fabric,"[FAB-5267] Switch Broadcast filter w/ msgprocessor

When the Enqueue method was removed in favor of the Order/Configure
methods, the existing Broadcast code continued to use them very much
like the old Enqueue method.

This CR removes the hack which allowed the Broadcast code to continue to
function and instead leverages the msgprocessor code to appropriately
route messages to either Order or Configure.

Because the filters were removed from the blockcutter, the only place
they are currently used is in the Broadcast path.  This injects an
unneeded dependency into the Broadcast framework, making tests more
difficult to mock, and generally complicating the code.

This CR removes the filtering from the Broadcast path, in favor of doing
the filtering entirely in the msgprocessor path.  This was at one point
split into two CRs around issue FAB-5268, but it turned out to be
infeasible to break this into two changes while not breaking the e2e.

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1617
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1619

This changeset removes some of the duplicated orderer bootstrap code
from the protos/utils package.  It does this by introducing a
common/configtx/test package which uses a sample config template to
produce a genesis block.

This can also be used in the future for clients wishing to create a
chain creation transaction.  This is demonstrated in the
broadcast_config client.

This removes the vestigal utils methods for creating configuration
transactions via the 'oldConfiguration' mechanisms.

Originally, .methods was used for methods in a ROM class, and
locals_dict for methods in a user-created class.  That distinction is
unnecessary, and we can use locals_dict for ROM classes now that we have
ROMable maps.

This removes an entry in the bloated mp_obj_type_t struct, saving a word
for each ROM object and each RAM object.  ROM objects that have a
methods table (now a locals_dict) need an extra word in total (removed
the methods pointer (1 word), no longer need the sentinel (2 words), but
now need an mp_obj_dict_t wrapper (4 words)).  But RAM objects save a
word because they never used the methods entry.

Overall the ROM usage is down by a few hundred bytes, and RAM usage is
down 1 word per user-defined type/class.

There is less code (no need to check 2 tables), and now consistent with
the way ROM modules have their tables initialised.

Efficiency is very close to equivaluent.

Changed Center Line from being the RX Carrier line to represent TX Carrier line

Works best with CW Freq. Offset = ""CW RX"".

Slight changes to the frequency bar (removed main frequency full display),
changed layout for 4xmagnify to use 4 instead of 6 frequencies since
the rounding made some of the markings irritating. Might need more thought.

DOES NOT SUPPORT SPLIT, DOES NOT SUPPORT RIT: In both cases wrong center line

This changeset belongs to the series of commits that simplify our AST model
to make it less rough on the edges.

The motivation behind this change is as follows: 1) remove a very rarely
used interpolator, 2) remove an exotic trait from our syntax model,
3) simplify the life of newcomers and experts that want to extract stuff
from an application and insert that stuff elsewhere.

Concretely:
  * Term.Arg.Named becomes Term.Assign (and it should've been so for a
    long time, as pointed out in one of the meetings, iirc by Lukas Rytz)
  * Term.Arg.Repeated becomes Term.Repeated
  * q""..."" is modified to accommodate q""$expr: _*""

Safety by construction is temporarily compromised, but will be restored
in subsequent commits that will change the AST infrastructure to accommodate
parent-based validations.

601bc18de3e191ba1b7af0b508d54e76047b8735,symfony/http-kernel,"Replaced EventDispatcher by Doctrine's EventManager implementation

Doctrine's EventManager implementation has several advantages over the
EventDispatcher implementation of Symfony2. Therefore I suggest that we
use their implementation.

Advantages:

 * Event Listeners are objects, not callbacks. These objects have handler
   methods that have the same name as the event. This helps a lot when
   reading the code and makes the code for adding an event listener shorter.
 * You can create Event Subscribers, which are event listeners with an
   additional getSubscribedEvents() method. The benefit here is that the
   code that registers the subscriber doesn't need to know about its
   implementation.
 * All events are defined in static Events classes, so users of IDEs benefit
   of code completion
 * The communication between the dispatching class of an event and all
   listeners is done through a subclass of EventArgs. This subclass can be
   tailored to the type of event. A constructor, setters and getters can be
   implemented that verify the validity of the data set into the object.
   See examples below.
 * Because each event type corresponds to an EventArgs implementation,
   developers of event listeners can look up the available EventArgs methods
   and benefit of code completion.
 * EventArgs::stopPropagation() is more flexible and (IMO) clearer to use
   than notifyUntil(). Also, it is a concept that is also used in other
   event implementations

Before:

    class EventListener
    {
        public function handle(EventInterface $event, $data) { ... }
    }

    $dispatcher->connect('core.request', array($listener, 'handle'));
    $dispatcher->notify('core.request', new Event(...));

After (with listeners):

    final class Events
    {
        const onCoreRequest = 'onCoreRequest';
    }

    class EventListener
    {
        public function onCoreRequest(RequestEventArgs $eventArgs) { ... }
    }

    $evm->addEventListener(Events::onCoreRequest, $listener);
    $evm->dispatchEvent(Events::onCoreRequest, new RequestEventArgs(...));

After (with subscribers):

    class EventSubscriber
    {
        public function onCoreRequest(RequestEventArgs $eventArgs) { ... }

        public function getSubscribedEvents()
        {
            return Events::onCoreRequest;
        }
    }

    $evm->addEventSubscriber($subscriber);
    $evm->dispatchEvent(Events::onCoreRequest, new RequestEventArgs(...));

This PR simplifies and generalises some of the code in `field.py` for creating gradients of `Fields`. It also extends the unit tests and makes them more robust.
Specifically, this PR replaces the `CentralDifferences` function from `field.py` with numpy inbuilt `gradient` function, while shortening and simplifying the code.

This has a few implications:
- `field.gradient()` now returns two numpy arrays, rather than `Field` objects. This is in closer agreement to the behaviour of other methods in `field.py`. Users can of course create `Field` objects from these numpy-arrays themselves
- `field.gradient()` does not take the arguments `timerange`, `lonrange` and `latrange` anymore. Again, if users want the gradients of only a subset of a field, they can first create a new (smaller) field themselves and run the `.gradient()` method on that subset
- `particleset.density()` now calculates density using `xi` and `yi`. This means that fields are shifted by half a grid cell to the upper-right compared to the previous implementation

Functions work for RectilinearGrids automatically. For CurvilinearGrids, we ask users to provide fields of `.grid.cell_edge_sizes['x']` and `.grid.cell_edge_sizes['y']` themselves (see example in `tests/test_fieldset.py`"

07df40babb0231b2e8a2f42341805b4bbcc4e284,domob1812/huntercore,"[test] Add CCoinsViewCache Access/Modify/Write tests

Add more comprehensive unit tests for CCoinsViewCache. Right now it is hard to
refactor caching code or fix bugs in the caching logic because you have to try
to mentally enumerate all the different states the cache might be in to make
sure a change doesn't cause unintended consequences. The new tests explicitly
enumerate relevant cache states, documenting and verifying the behavior in each
state, so it will be safer and easier to make changes to the caching code in
the future.

Change the logic of estimateSmartFee to check a 60% threshold at half the target, a 85% threshold at the target and a 95% threshold at double the target. Always check the shortest time horizon possible and ensure that estimates are monotonically decreasing.  Add a conservative mode, which makes sure that the 95% threshold is also met at longer time horizons as well.

- *Replace usage of boost::asio with [libevent2](http://libevent.org/)*.
boost::asio is not part of C++11, so unlike other boost there is no
forwards-compatibility reason to stick with it. Together with #4738 (convert
json_spirit to UniValue), this rids Bitcoin Core of the worst offenders with
regard to compile-time slowness.

- *Replace spit-and-duct-tape http server with evhttp*. Front-end http handling
is handled by libevent, a work queue (with configurable depth and parallelism)
is used to handle application requests.

- *Wrap HTTP request in C++ class*; this makes the application code mostly
HTTP-server-neutral

- *Refactor RPC to move all http-specific code to a separate file*.
Theoreticaly this can allow building without HTTP server but with another RPC
backend, e.g. Qt's debug console (currently not implemented) or future RPC
mechanisms people may want to use.

- *HTTP dispatch mechanism*; services (e.g., RPC, REST) register which URL
paths they want to handle.

By using a proven, high-performance asynchronous networking library (also used
by Tor) and HTTP server, problems such as #5674, #5655, #344 should be avoided.

What works? bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-qt. Unit tests and RPC/REST tests
pass. The aim for now is everything but SSL support.

Configuration options:

- `-rpcthreads`: repurposed as ""number of  work handler threads"". Still
defaults to 4.

- `-rpcworkqueue`: maximum depth of work queue. When this is reached, new
requests will return a 500 Internal Error.

- `-rpctimeout`: inactivity time, in seconds, after which to disconnect a
client.

- `-debug=http`: low-level http activity logging

Gets rid of `MainFrameRepaint` in favor of specific update functions that tell the UI exactly what changed.

This improves the efficiency of various handlers. Also fixes problems with mined transactions not showing up until restart.

The following notifications were added:

- `NotifyBlocksChanged`: Block chain changed
- `NotifyKeyStoreStatusChanged`: Wallet status (encrypted, locked) changed.
- `NotifyAddressBookChanged`: Address book entry changed.
- `NotifyTransactionChanged`: Wallet transaction added, removed or updated.
- `NotifyNumConnectionsChanged`: Number of connections changed.
- `NotifyAlertChanged`: New, updated or cancelled alert. As this finally makes it possible for the UI to know when a new alert arrived, it can be shown as OS notification.

These notifications could also be useful for RPC clients. However, currently, they are ignored in bitcoind (in noui.cpp).

Also brings back polling with timer for numBlocks in ClientModel. This value updates so frequently during initial download that the number of signals clogs the UI thread and causes heavy CPU usage. And after initial block download, the value changes so rarely that a delay of half a second until the UI updates is unnoticable.

* common: remove CurrencyToString

Move denomination values to params instead.

* common: delete dead code

* common: move big integer operations to common/math

This commit consolidates all big integer operations into common/math and
adds tests and documentation.

There should be no change in semantics for BigPow, BigMin, BigMax, S256,
U256, Exp and their behaviour is now locked in by tests.

The BigD, BytesToBig and Bytes2Big functions don't provide additional
value, all uses are replaced by new(big.Int).SetBytes().

BigToBytes is now called PaddedBigBytes, its minimum output size
parameter is now specified as the number of bytes instead of bits. The
single use of this function is in the EVM's MSTORE instruction.

Big and String2Big are replaced by ParseBig, which is slightly stricter.
It previously accepted leading zeros for hexadecimal inputs but treated
decimal inputs as octal if a leading zero digit was present.

ParseUint64 is used in places where String2Big was used to decode a
uint64.

The new functions MustParseBig and MustParseUint64 are now used in many

30cd5c18549f645002aedb4c00e5bab683cb0835,ethereum/go-ethereum,"all: new p2p node representation (#17643)

Package p2p/enode provides a generalized representation of p2p nodes
which can contain arbitrary information in key/value pairs. It is also
the new home for the node database. The ""v4"" identity scheme is also
moved here from p2p/enr to remove the dependency on Ethereum crypto from
that package.

Record signature handling is changed significantly. The identity scheme
registry is removed and acceptable schemes must be passed to any method
that needs identity. This means records must now be validated explicitly
after decoding.

The enode API is designed to make signature handling easy and safe: most
APIs around the codebase work with enode.Node, which is a wrapper around
a valid record. Going from enr.Record to enode.Node requires a valid
signature.

* p2p/discover: port to p2p/enode

This ports the discovery code to the new node representation in
p2p/enode. The wire protocol is unchanged, this can be considered a
refactoring change. The Kademlia table can now deal with nodes using an
arbitrary identity scheme. This requires a few incompatible API changes:

  - Table.Lookup is not available anymore. It used to take a public key
    as argument because v4 protocol requires one. Its replacement is
    LookupRandom.
  - Table.Resolve takes *enode.Node instead of NodeID. This is also for
    v4 protocol compatibility because nodes cannot be looked up by ID
    alone.
  - Types Node and NodeID are gone. Further commits in the series will be
    fixes all over the the codebase to deal with those removals.

* p2p: port to p2p/enode and discovery changes

This adapts package p2p to the changes in p2p/discover. All uses of
discover.Node and discover.NodeID are replaced by their equivalents from
p2p/enode.

New API is added to retrieve the enode.Node instance of a peer. The
behavior of Server.Self with discovery disabled is improved. It now
tries much harder to report a working IP address, falling back to
127.0.0.1 if no suitable address can be determined through other means.
These changes were needed for tests of other packages later in the
series.

* p2p/simulations, p2p/testing: port to p2p/enode

No surprises here, mostly replacements of discover.Node, discover.NodeID
with their new equivalents. The 'interesting' API changes are:

 - testing.ProtocolSession tracks complete nodes, not just their IDs.
 - adapters.NodeConfig has a new method to create a complete node.

These changes were needed to make swarm tests work.

Note that the NodeID change makes the code incompatible with old
simulation snapshots.

* whisper/whisperv5, whisper/whisperv6: port to p2p/enode

This port was easy because whisper uses []byte for node IDs and
URL strings in the API.

* eth: port to p2p/enode

Again, easy to port because eth uses strings for node IDs and doesn't
care about node information in any way.

* les: port to p2p/enode

Apart from replacing discover.NodeID with enode.ID, most changes are in
the server pool code. It now deals with complete nodes instead
of (Pubkey, IP, Port) triples. The database format is unchanged for now,
but we should probably change it to use the node database later.

* node: port to p2p/enode

This change simply replaces discover.Node and discover.NodeID with their
new equivalents.

* swarm/network: port to p2p/enode

Swarm has its own node address representation, BzzAddr, containing both
an overlay address (the hash of a secp256k1 public key) and an underlay
address (enode:// URL).

There are no changes to the BzzAddr format in this commit, but certain
operations such as creating a BzzAddr from a node ID are now impossible
because node IDs aren't public keys anymore.

Most swarm-related changes in the series remove uses of
NewAddrFromNodeID, replacing it with NewAddr which takes a complete node
as argument. ToOverlayAddr is removed because we can just use the node
ID directly.

a1d9ef48c505ab4314ca8e3ee1fc272032da3034,ethereum/go-ethereum,"core, eth, rpc: split out block validator and state processor

This removes the burden on a single object to take care of all
validation and state processing. Now instead the validation is done by
the `core.BlockValidator` (`types.Validator`) that takes care of both
header and uncle validation through the `ValidateBlock` method and state
validation through the `ValidateState` method. The state processing is
done by a new object `core.StateProcessor` (`types.Processor`) and
accepts a new state as input and uses that to process the given block's
transactions (and uncles for rewords) to calculate the state root for
the next block (P_n + 1).

	fcmh_load_fcoo()		start fcoo if not present.
	fcmh_load_fcoo_nostart()	only return true if fcoo is present.

	fcmh_getload()			create or find an fcmh by fg and
					load attributes as necessary.

	fcmh_load_fmi()			acquire a file descriptor on MDS
	fcmh_load_fci()			acquire a file descriptor on CLI
	fcmh_load_fii()			acquire a file descriptor on ION

client/server/security impact:
  fcoo_fdb changes into fci_cfd.  the mere fact that we stored fdb in the
  fcoo shows that fdb is not fitted for the design we want.

  if running over an trusted network, it adds unnecessary overhead and complication.

  if running over an untrusted network, an attacker could craft his open OPEN
  message, so the fdbuf doesnt really provide any benefit whatsoever.

because I'm lazy but also because things are very integrated:

- modify fcmh sub-structure initialization as the fcoo pieces were merged
  directly into fcmh.
- CREATE needs a slash_creds.

impact from these changes:
- cleanup will require the new bmap releasing changes; until then, resources
  will become scarce quickly as things won't move to the cleanlist.

- use __pakced
- first bits of passing the bmap generation around during relication work
  so the MDS can be sure the IONs have up-to-date replications
- only set ACTIVE->OLD in mds_repl_inv_except_locked().
  SCHED should not be changed, as OLD will be marked if the replication
  finished but there is a newer bmap generation than the one from the
  replication status update
- on startup, revert all bmap SCHED status of replications to OLD.
  this imposes an unfortunate startup penalty on crash but is the only
  was to recommence queuing replication work
- add bmap_2_bgen()
- when setting SCHED, write the bh_repls changes to disk.  currently,
  the changes would only stay in-memory and we be lost as soon as we
  release the bmap which happened essentially right after we set SCHED.
  this approach to tracking replication status is easier than making a
  new mechanism which holds in-memory state for bmaps for some fields
  that can change (such as any of them except...) but some that can't
  (such as parts of the bh_repls set to SCHED)
- if a bmap is marked OLD instead of SCHED when receiving replication
  status updates from the ION, change it to ACTIVE anyway.  this goes
  hand in hand with the reverting of SCHED->OLD on startup

it's all read-only; it doesn't listen for any other actions other
than the one that initially injects it into state.

Because of this there is a lot of basic machinery in place which
supports that simple fetching. However, that also makes it a
perfect candidate for beta testing with the new `getHttpData()`
helper function which removes the ""boilerplate""

In this patch I'm removing the Redux and traditional data-layer
machinery in favor of the `requestHttpData()` getter and system.

* Remove unnecessary test

* Update reference in connect()

- netcdf.py was added as a fallback in case scipy.io.netcdf is
  not available
  - adjusted imports (e.g. use six instead of scipy._lib.six)
  - small doc string changes
- The Amber netcdf reader will try to load scipy.io.netcdf first
  but will use MDAnalysis.lib.netcdf if scipy is not available.
- Added the test_netcdf.py file as test_scipy_io_netcdf.py and the
  example_1.nc data file; adjusted the test to use tempdir and
  other MDAnalysis conventions. lib.netcdf is thus always tested.
- Removed the skipif decorators from all Amber NC tests because
  from now on, Amber trajectories should always be readable and
  writable.
- Fixed test failure testing NC dimensions attributes (with
  scipy.io.netcdf)
- Removed setup.py [AMBER] install target, which installed scipy, because
  scipy is a required dependency since 0.16.2
- netcdf tests run under pytest
- updated test MANIFEST to ensure that everything is included

en visible, and each time it gets showed. I already made some RS pages derive from this page.
- Modified and renamed the taskGraphPainterWidget to display info about currently selected file transfers. For know, it only shows file chunks info, but we should use it to display additional info about the transfer. Warning: in its
 current state, only fake chunk info is displayed.
 - Suppressed p3files.h, because it is not used.

 Remains to do (in order):
 - Implement a chunk map class in ft/ to properly manage which chunks should be downloaded 
 - Display correct chunk info by requesting the transfer's chunk map
 - Add check-sum verification of chunks
 - allow RS to import a partially downloaded file by force re-checking chunks
 - Add chunk map exchange from file source peer id to file destination peer id.
 - Manage chunks from different peers.
 - Allow search (turtle search) for partially downloaded files

As a consequence we use CndImporter instead of the lower-level

add GenericAPIServer posthooks for initialization

Adds the concept of a `PostStartHook` to the `GenericAPIServer` to allow post-server start hooks.  This gives a standard location to perform post-start bootstrapping tasks.  The common case usage we have downstream are security related bootstrapping tasks that are performed on the ""empty etcd"" initialization cases.  The RBAC authorizer is a good example of this in kube.  It needs a location to create default policies to start a server which is capable of being accessed.

Kube is also likely to hit this for things like PSP and breaking the monolithic controller user into separate, scoped service accounts.

@kubernetes/sig-api-machinery for the `GenericAPIServer` bits
@kubernetes/sig-auth for the particular clusterrole bootstrapping. I've only done one to start, but I suspect we'll start making more and probably introduce a binding so that the RBAC super-user doesn't remain a special case forever."

In the past the discovery configuration expected, that we can support multiple

servers.
Therefore, to reduce complexity and improve readability of the config, the
multiple API server endpoints support is removed from the bootstrap token

Move kubelet ComponentConfig external types to `k8s.io/kubelet`

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR implements most of kubernetes/community#2354 for the kubelet.
The PR:
 - Moves `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/kubeletconfig` as-is to `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/config` as agreed
 - Moves the external types to the new staging repo `k8s.io/kubelet`, in the `k8s.io/kubelet/config/v1beta1` package.
 - Makes `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/config/v1beta1` source the types from `k8s.io/kubelet/config/v1beta1`. The defaulting and conversion code is kept in this package as before.
 - All references to these packages have been updated.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
ref: kubernetes/community#2354

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

This PR depends on getting https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67780 merged first.

**Release note**:

```release-note
kubelet v1beta1 external ComponentConfig types are now available in the `k8s.io/kubelet` repo

code-generator: rewrite hack/update-codecs.sh into reusable generate-{internal,}-groups.sh

Generating everything for groups inside of an apiserver (with internal types) becomes:

```shell
generate-internal-groups.sh all ""$(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE})/../../.."" k8s.io/sample-apiserver/pkg/client k8s.io/sample-apiserver/pkg/apis k8s.io/sample-apiserver/pkg/apis wardle:v1alpha1
```

Generating everything for a CRD (versioned types) becomes:

```shell
generate-groups.sh all ""$(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE})/../../.."" k8s.io/sample-apiserver/pkg/client k8s.io/sample-apiserver/pkg/apis wardle:v1alpha1
```

This should cover the 90% percent use-case. For the other 10% this can be forked and adapted as needed.

Furthermore, we can put this into a Docker container. Then code-generator consumers can do:

```shell
$ docker run -v $GOPATH:/go k8s.io/code-generator:1.8 generate-group.sh github.com/foo/bar example:v1
```

This is only possibly only the first step towards a `code-generator` binary. For the later deeper generator changes are necessary (e.g. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53202) and hence the later is only feasible in 1.9. **This PR here in contrast, we can cherry-pick to 1.8.**

```release-note
Add generate-groups.sh and generate-internal-groups.sh to k8s.io/code-generator to easily run generators against CRD or User API Server types.
```

Prepare VolumeHost for running mount tools in containers

This is the first part of implementation of https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/278 - running mount utilities in containers.

It updates `VolumeHost` interface:

*  `GetMounter()` now requires volume plugin name, as it is going to return different mounter to different volume plugings, because mount utilities for these plugins can be on different places.
* New `GetExec()` method that should volume plugins use to execute any utilities. This new `Exec` interface will execute them on proper place.
* `SafeFormatAndMount` is updated to the new `Exec` interface.

This is just a preparation, `GetExec` right now leads to simple `os.Exec` and mount utilities are executed on the same place as before. Also, the volume plugins will be updated in subsequent PRs (split into separate PRs, some plugins required lot of changes).

Separate Direct and Indirect streaming paths, implement indirect path for CRI

This PR refactors the `pkg/kubelet/container.Runtime` interface to remove the `ExecInContainer`, `PortForward` and `AttachContainer` methods. Instead, those methods are part of the `DirectStreamingRuntime` interface which all ""legacy"" runtimes implement. I also added an `IndirectStreamingRuntime` which handles the redirect path and is implemented by CRI runtimes. To control the size of this PR, I did not fully setup the indirect streaming path for the dockershim, so I left legacy path behind.

Most of this PR is moving & renaming associated with the refactoring. To understand the functional changes, I suggest tracing the code from `getExec` in `pkg/kubelet/server/server.go`, which calls `GetExec` in `pkg/kubelet/kubelet_pods.go` to determine whether to follow the direct or indirect path.

Redesign and implement volume reconstruction work

This PR is the first part of redesign of volume reconstruction work. The detailed design information is https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1601

The changes include
1. Remove dependency on volume spec stored in actual state for volume
cleanup process (UnmountVolume and UnmountDevice)

Modify AttachedVolume struct to add DeviceMountPath so that volume
unmount operation can use this information instead of constructing from
volume spec

2. Modify reconciler's volume reconstruction process (syncState). Currently workflow
is when kubelet restarts, syncState() is only called once before
reconciler starts its loop.
a. If volume plugin supports reconstruction, it will use the
reconstructed volume spec information to update actual state as before.
b. If volume plugin cannot support reconstruction, it will use the
scanned mount path information to clean up the mounts.

In this PR, all the plugins still support reconstruction (except
glusterfs), so reconstruction of some plugins will still have issues.
The next PR will modify those plugins that cannot support reconstruction
well.

This PR addresses issue #52683"

move KubeletConfiguration out of componentconfig API group

I'm splitting #44252 into more manageable steps. This step moves the types and updates references.

To reviewers: the most important changes are the removals from pkg/apis/componentconfig and additions to pkg/kubelet/apis/kubeletconfig. Almost everything else is an import or name update.

I have one unanswered question: Should I create a whole new api scheme for Kubelet APIs rather than register e.g. a kubeletconfig group with the default runtime.Scheme instance? This feels like the right thing, as the Kubelet should be exposing its own API, but there's a big fat warning not to do this in `pkg/api/register.go`. Can anyone answer this?"

Update to rules_go 0.12.1 and gazelle 0.12.0 and perform related cleanups

**What this PR does / why we need it**: my initial intent was to simply update to rules_go 0.12.1 and gazelle 0.12.0.

A few internal changes / deprecations meant that I finally needed to clean up some technical debt. This also fixes #64122.
I've attempted to keep the steps as separate commits to make it easier to review:

1. Disable gazelle proto rule generation; legacy proto rules are deprecated, and we don't (currently) build protos at build time anyway, instead generating them with `hack/update-generated-protobuf.sh` and then checking them in. We can revisit this in the future if we'd like.
2. Remove the legacy `go_default_library_protos` filegroups using [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildozer). We don't use these, anyway.
3. Update the rules_go bazel workspace dependency to 0.12.1.
4. Vendor gazelle 0.12.0 and update BUILD files with `hack/update-bazel.sh`. This causes a lot of diffs, because `select()`s are no longer used in `srcs` attributes, external tests are folded into non-external tests, and vendored targets get an `importmap` attribute.
5. Set `gazelle:prefix` on `staging/src/BUILD` to make gazelle treat these correctly(ish). This allows us to remove the sed rewrite hack in `hack/update-bazel.sh`.
6. Explicitly set `# gazelle:importmap_prefix k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor` on `vendor/`, so that all vendored dependencies get the right importmap. gazelle 0.12.0 uses the bazel workspace name + `vendor/` as a prefix, which doesn't work with native go. Newer gazelle will use the go prefix (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/207), but it's not released yet. Setting this correctly now also fixes later `BUILD` churn.
7. Re-run `hack/update-bazel.sh`. This causes a bunch of diffs, since anything under `staging/src` now uses the `staging/src/` path instead of `vendor/`. (Both would work for bazel, but gazelle uses the former, since `vendor/` uses symlinks.) Also `importmap`s under `vendor/` are fixed.
8. Reformat a few files (using [buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildifier)) to make later diffs easier to read.
9. Rework the `go_genrule` rules to use the new `go_genrule` from https://github.com/kubernetes/repo-infra/pull/72, which is more bazely, since it uses the rules_go `go_path` rule instead of lots of shell.
10. Remove the deprecated `go_prefix` rule from the root BUILD.bazel file.
11. Set `# gazelle:importmap_prefix k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor` on `staging/src` as well, which ensures that these repos are treated as vendored dependencies. (It's basically the bazel-y way of doing the `vendor/k8s.io` symlinks.)
12. Run `hack/update-bazel.sh` one last time to fix all of the `importmap`s under `staging/src`.

Note re: point 6 above - we're pretty much ignoring the `vendor/k8s.io` symlinks entirely now under bazel. Using the `gazelle:prefix` directive ensures these get mapped into the right go importpath, and the `go_path` rule installs these correctly now too.

**Special notes for your reviewer**: this should not be submitted before https://github.com/kubernetes/repo-infra/pull/72, obviously.

**Release note**:

```release-note
NONE

Make kubectl edit work with unstructured objects

Fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/35993


1. First (before any other changes), added several test cases for complex edit scenarios:
   - [x] ensure the edit loop bails out if given the same result that already caused errors
   - [x] ensure an edited file with a syntax error is reopened preserving the input
   - [x] ensure objects with existing ""caused-by"" annotations get updated with the current command

2. Refactored the edit code to prep for switching to unstructured:
   - [x] made editFn operate on a slice of resource.Info objects passed as an arg, regardless of edit mode
   - [x] simplified short-circuiting logic when re-editing a file containing an error
   - [x] refactored how we build the various visitors (namespace enforcement, annotation application, patching, creating) so we could easily switch to just using a single visitor over a set of resource infos read from the updated input for all of them

3. Switched to using a resource builder to parse the stream of the user's edited output
   - [x] improve the error message you get on syntax errors
   - [x] preserve the user's input more faithfully (see how the captured testcase requests to the server changed to reflect exactly what the user edited)
   - [x] stopped doing client-side conversion (means deprecating `--output-version`)

4. Switched edit to work with generic objects
   - [x] use unstructured objects
   - [x] fall back to generic json merge patch for unrecognized group/version/kinds

5. Added new test cases
   - [x] schemaless objects falls back to generic json merge (covers TPR scenario)
   - [x] edit unknown version of known kind (version ""v0"" of storageclass) falls back to generic json merge

```release-note
`kubectl edit` now edits objects exactly as they were retrieved from the API. This allows using `kubectl edit` with third-party resources and extension API servers. Because client-side conversion is no longer done, the `--output-version` option is deprecated for `kubectl edit`. To edit using a particular API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group used to fetch the object (for example, `job.v1.batch/myjob`)

Add storage.k8s.io/v1 API

v1 API is direct copy of v1beta1 API. This v1 API gets installed and exposed in this PR, I tested that kubectl can create both v1beta1 and v1 StorageClass.

~~Rest of Kubernetes (controllers, examples,. tests, ...) still use v1beta1 API, I will update it when this PR gets merged as these changes would get lost among generated code.~~ Most parts use v1 API now, it would not compile / run tests without it.

**Release note**:
```
Kubernetes API storage.k8s.io for storage objects is now fully supported and is available as storage.k8s.io/v1. Beta version of the API storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 is still available in this release, however it will be removed in a future Kubernetes release.

Together with the API endpoint, StorageClass annotation ""storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class"" is deprecated and  ""storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class"" should be used instead to mark a default storage class. The beta annotation is still working in this release, however it won't be supported in the next one.

 move webhook admission to generic apiserver

This builds on https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54414.

It moves the admission webhook into the generic apiserver.  It also allows the injection of a server managed way to override the rest.Config used for a particular service.  This makes for an easier point to allow auto-configuration of the kube-apiserver to loopback to itself as a special case for kubernetes.default.svc.

Update the kubectl plugin mechanism

**Release note**:
```release-note
The plugin mechanism functionality to closely follow the git plugin design
```

Replace the existing plugin mechanism with the design proposed in https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2437.

~~_The full implementation of the plugin mechanism itself is entirely contained within the first commit._~~

## Walkthrough

Under the new design, there is no plugin installation or loading required to use plugins.
A plugin is simply any executable file on a user's PATH whose name begins with `kubectl-`.
- Plugins receive the inherited environment from the `kubectl` binary. All environment variables
accessible by `kubectl` become accessible by the plugin.
- Plugins decide which command path they wish to implement based on their name. For example, a plugin wanting to provide a new command `foo`, would simply be named `kubectl-foo`.

### Creating a plugin

Below is an example plugin, that we will use for this walkthrough. Plugins may be written in any language, and handle arguments and flags in any way, optionally (as a convention) providing a way to retrieve their version via a `version` subcommand.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# optional argument handling
if [[ ""$1"" == ""version"" ]]
then
    echo ""1.0.0""
    exit 0
fi

# optional argument handling
if [[ ""$1"" == ""config"" ]]
then
    echo $KUBECONFIG
    exit 0
fi

echo ""I am a plugin named kubectl-foo""
```

### Using a plugin

To use a plugin, simply make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./kubectl-foo
```

and place it anywhere in your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv ./kubectl-foo /usr/local/bin
```

You may now invoke your plugin as a `kubectl` command:

```bash
$ kubectl foo
I am a plugin named kubectl-foo
```

All args and flags are passed as-is to the executable:

```bash
$ kubectl foo version
1.0.0
```

All environment variables are also passed as-is to the executable:

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
$ kubectl foo config
/home/<user>/.kube/config

$ KUBECONFIG=/etc/kube/config kubectl foo config
/etc/kube/config
```

Additionally, the first argument that is passed to a plugin will always be the full path to the location where it was invoked (`$0` would equal `/usr/local/bin/kubectl-foo` in our example above).

### Plugin discoverability

Seeing as how the `kubectl plugin` command is left as a no-op with this PR (perhaps it could serve as an entrypoint towards additional plugin functionality in the future), a small subcommand has been included that _lists all available plugin executables on a user's PATH_, along with any warnings it finds.

Example usage of this new subcommand is included below:

```bash
$ kubectl plugin list
The following kubectl-compatible plugins are available:

test/fixtures/pkg/kubectl/plugins/kubectl-foo
plugins/kubectl-foo
  - warning: plugins/kubectl-foo is overshadowed by a similarly named plugin: test/fixtures/pkg/kubectl/plugins/kubectl-foo
plugins/kubectl-invalid
  - warning: plugins/kubectl-invalid identified as a kubectl plugin, but it is not executable
plugins/kubectl-bar

error: 2 plugin warnings were found
```

RESTClient is an abstraction on top of arbitrary HTTP endpoints that

b02481708a369f2f5bc49f59fb71ee8d5a0c8c12,kubernetes/kubernetes,"Fix volume states out of sync problem after kubelet restarts

When kubelet restarts, all the information about the volumes will be
gone from actual/desired states. When update node status with mounted
volumes, the volume list might be empty although there are still volumes
are mounted and in turn causing master to detach those volumes since
they are not in the mounted volumes list. This fix is to make sure only
update mounted volumes list after reconciler starts sync states process.
This sync state process will scan the existing volume directories and
reconstruct actual states if they are missing.

This PR also fixes the problem during orphaned pods' directories. In
case of the pod directory is unmounted but has not yet deleted (e.g.,
interrupted with kubelet restarts), clean up routine will delete the
directory so that the pod directoriy could be cleaned up (it is safe to
delete directory since it is no longer mounted)

The third issue this PR fixes is that during reconstruct volume in
actual state, mounter could not be nil since it is required for creating
container.VolumeMap. If it is nil, it might cause nil pointer exception
in kubelet.

Details are in proposal PR #33203

    Prepatory work for removing cloud provider dependency from node
    controller running in Kube Controller Manager. Splitting the node
    controller into its two major pieces life-cycle and CIDR/IP
    management. Both pieces currently need the the cloud system to do their work.
    Removing lifecycles dependency on cloud will be fixed ina followup PR.
    
    Moved node scheduler code to live with node lifecycle controller.
    Got the IPAM/Lifecycle split completed. Still need to rename pieces.
    Made changes to the utils and tests so they would be in the appropriate
    package.
    Moved the node based ipam code to nodeipam.
    Made the relevant tests pass.
    Moved common node controller util code to nodeutil.
    Removed unneeded pod informer sync from node ipam controller.

Currently, whenever there is any update, kubelet would force all pod workers to
sync again, causing resource contention and hence performance degradation.

This commit flips kubelet to use incremental updates (as opposed to snapshots).
This allows us to know what pods have changed and send updates to those pod
workers only. The `SyncPods` function has been replaced with individual
handlers, each handling an operation (ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE). Pod workers are
still triggered periodically, and kubelet performs periodic cleanup as well.

This commit also spawns a new goroutine solely responsible for killing pods.
This is necessary because pod killing could hold up the sync loop for
indefinitely long amount of time now user can define the graceful termination
period in the container spec.

Loads of clean-ups along the way.

Fixes #1573

* Moves all helpers modules to templatetags.jinja_helpers - there are a few things in there that aren't jinja related so there'll be a follow-up to split that later
* Update Jinja2 to 2.9.6
* Add django-jinja 2.3.1
* move some jingo-minify helpers to olympia.lib to avoid any jingo imports
* unified |f and |fe helpers into one |format_html helper that always escapes everything unless the input is already |safe

* Move helpers, add requirements, fix imports.
* Give backend a proper name
* Port f and fe filters from jingo
* Make start porting reviews jinja helpers module, make first test pass
* Get a handful more tests working, get rid of get_env, more and more jingo calls.
* Disable extension matching, render .txt templates too, fixes more stats tests
* Fix csv_header template to produce some reasonable and csv parsable
* Set trim_blocks to be compatible with jingo
* Unify |f and |fe into one |format that simplifies escaping rules. Update tests.

I think having one unified |format filter is beneficial, especially
given that our current escaping rules were kinda complicated and allowed
for seriously dangerous combinations even with autoescape activated.

Now everything passed as an argument to |format is explicitly escaped
unless marked as |safe, there's no way around that anymore.

* Naive first version using |format instead of |f and |fe, might need more review.
* Fix format for unicode strings
* Rename |format to |format_html
* Move nl2br_xhtml to amo.jinja_helpers, use it in all our templates.
* Move datetime filter to our code temporarily, fix mocks, fix recursive error
* Move csrf call to django_jinja csrf_token tag, fix addons templatetags
* Fix |class_selected usage, fix render_with to get registered
* Remove hack from zadmin, fix zadmin templatetags
* Fix user delete photo test, don't rely on proper context updates that happen in order.
* Fix more nl2br tests
* Fix detail page escape, django escapes differently than jinja
* Remove context from edit_review_reply_form
* Fix date created format filter usage
* Remove templates setting user, fix can_review
* Fix collect_add_widget to not inherit the global context
* Remove happy unicode client
* Cleanup can_review, add tests
* Fix tests, django use different html character for double quote escaping
* Switch to firefox latest to check ui-tests
* Cleanup and fix do_truncate
* Remove jingo, copy jingo-minify helpers that depend on jingo to our lib for now
* Rename nl2br_xhtml -> nl2br
* Jinja 2.9 compat for reviews truncate filter
* Don't use TEMPLATE_DEBUG
* Set default value for q, happens on index page.
* Fix jinja2 formatting with newstyle gettext"

42a8770a49e0342acffa7fdde22655c98e783184,noironetworks/neutron,"Make DhcpRpcCallback a separate callback class

RPC has a version of itself. In Neutron a plugin implements
several RPC interface, so a single RPC version doesn't work.
In Mixin callback class approach, RPC versioning depends on
each plugin implementation and it makes harder to maintain
RPC version appropriately. This patch series replaces mixin
RPC callback of server side with a separate class.

This commit handles server-side callback of dhcp-agent RPC interface.
DHCP-agent server-side callback class is moved from db/ to
api/rpc/handlers because it doesn't involve any db operations
and defining all RPC interfaces in a single place sounds reasonable.

Note that moving other DHCP-agent related RPC interface class
to api/rpc/handlers can be done in a separate patch as this patch
focuses on reorganizing the server-side RPC callback class.

- shortens L3 extensions alias from 'os-quantum-router' to 'router' to
make attribute extensions more readable.

- Need to add policy logic so non-admin users can always see external
networks without requiring that these networks are shared (since VMs can
always create ports on shared networks, but provider may want to have
externals networks that VMs cannot directly plug into.

- prevent delete_network in plugins from implying it returns something
- modify extensions.py so that exceptions during calls to
get_extended_resources() will actually be logged if unexpected.
- unset executable bit on test_iptables_manager.py to make sure tox

- Import Practices from ODS XML TRUD files
  here https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/authenticated/group/0/pack/5/subpack/341/releases
  Note that data is also available from an API but would require about 9000 separate HTTP
  queries to get it all.. so maybe not. More reliable to rely on this xml file.
  Note GP imports will still rely on csv files not XML (for now - I believe there are plans to migrate
  the 'Prescribing Data' to XML.
- Convert primary care pyshician name into a single `name` field because
  we cannot reliably parse the data.nhs name e.g. “PINKERTON-SMITH JA”
  into family and given names.
- Make Patient & Practice has_many through a PracticeMembership. This allows us to soft delete
  a membership record during an import so we have a record of where the GP was working at any
  one time.
- Add Feed::File and Feed::FileType models under the Feeds namespace, the idea being we can use
  these to capture progress/result for file inputs eg practice, gp, drug, TT etc
- Add a bin/console helper: fires up rails console in spoec/dummy
- Don’t seed practice id as it upsets the pg sequence
- Using a Feeds::File object and a Practices::ImportJob
- Create a rake task to do it synchronously
- Import GPs
- Add a utility class to map countries
- Reset logging to errors only in test.rb
- Skip PracticeImportJob spec on CI for now as PG COPY not working on CI due a path issue.
- Add unrar and unzip to Docker image
- Practice memberships import
- Remove email from PrimaryCarePhysician: Emails are sent only to the practice address.
- Fix cucumber tag deprecations. the remaining ones reported are a bug in cucumber - see https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/issues/346

c2fcfa42b527088bd0fef521523128605f7b3215,alphagov/smart-answers,"Make ActionView ERB template search path flow-specific

Previously the `ActionView::Base` constructor was being passed the root (`/`)
of the file system as the path to search for ERB templates. This was necessary,
because the `Tempfiles` created in the test are being created in `/tmp`.

This is obviously undesirable, since there'd be a remote theoretical
possibility that the presenter could be forced to load and evaluate a template
in a file not related to the flow or even outside the project root altogether.

This commit makes the search path much more specific by setting it to the
template directory specific to the flow. The tests still need to override this
template directory, but the code feels safer.

849ff4057ae2db762d93685f2a06396f2675da19,alphagov/smart-answers,"Merge branch 'deploy-to-heroku'

We hope that allowing us to deploy to Heroku will make it easier to make
changes to existing Smart Answers.

The current mechanism for making changes to Smart Answers isn't ideal: We have
to duplicate everything about the Smart Answer, make the changes and then
deploy to preview for someone to view and test. See ""Making bigger changes""[1]
for more information.

We think that using git branches, instead of manually branching in the
filesystem, will make our lives easier in this situation. Although we can
deploy branches to Preview, the auto-deployment functionality means that we
can't guarantee how long they'll live. Allowing us to deploy to Heroku should
solve this particular problem.

In a few cases, add ‘#include ""foo.h""’ if the file needs foo.h
but does not include it directly.  As a general rule, a source
file should include foo.h if it needs the interfaces that foo.h
defines.

Extend the internal JTAG event handlers to cover enable/disable,
and use those events to make sure that targets get ""examined"" if
they were disabled when the scan chain was first set up:

 - Remove ""enum jtag_tap_event"", merge with ""enum jtag_event"",
   so C code can now listen for TAP enable/disable events.

 - Report those events so they can trigger callbacks.

 - During startup, make target_examine() register a handler to
   catch ENABLE events for any then-disabled targets.

This fixes bugs like ""can't halt target after enabling its TAP"".

One class of unresolved bugs:  if the target has an ETM hooked
up to an ETB, nothing activates the ETB.  But starting up the
ETM without access to the ETB registers fails...

        First pass on refactoring FoldConstants into separate peephole optimizations. This changelist adds the notion of an AbstractPeepholeOptimization and adds a PeepholeOptimizationsPass that runs them. In this go around the minimization aspects of FoldConstants have been factored out into PeepholeMinimize. A future change will factor out the other components of FoldConstants into their own PeepholeOptimizations. DefaultPassConfig has also been updated to run the new PeepholeOptimizationPass.

        This change does not move the minimization-related unit tests from FoldConstantsTest to PeepholeMinimizeTest -- a future, separate, change will do so. Hopefully this will make it easier to review.

46161c3af0189ca2616e9bff0ac626bf2ea047f3,qutebrowser/qutebrowser,"Refactor delete_cur_item.

Taking the completion widget as an argument was overly complex.
The process now looks like:

1. CompletionView gets deletion request
2. CompletionView passes selected index to CompletionModel
3. CompletionModel passes the row data to the owning category
4. The category runs its custom completion function.

This also fixes a bug. With the switch to the hybrid (list/sql)
completion model, the view was no longer updating when items were
deleted. This fixes that by ensuring the correct signals are emitted.

The SQL model must be refreshed by running the query. We could try using
a SqlTableModel so we can call removeRows instead.

The test for deleting a url fails because qmodeltester claims the length
of the query model is still 3.

* xian/refactor-shadow-wrangling:
  @Ignore some tests that don't make sense right now.
  Re-enable stack trace cleanup.
  Reformat debug.
  Move hard reference to last SdkEnvironment from EnvHolder to RobolectricTestRunner so it'll work if there are multiple EnvHolders. Start removing StrictI18n stuff.
  Generated bytecode is now optimized for the case where a method is not shadowed, which will soon be the normal case. Many fewer class reflection lookups are now performed per method invocation, even when a shadow is involved. The old directlyOn(instance) and directlyOn(class) methods are removed.
  Tear down static state explicitly after a test so classloaders are more likely to be GCable in some circumstances.
  Reuse one ant Project so we don't get a million executor thread pools.
  Initialize SecureRandom early so its PKCS11 thread is started in the normal classloader.
  Oops, add ShadowAbstractWindowedCursor shadow.

This was achieved by decoupling the base Component's implementation which provided the ""services"" of 1) wiping out connections and other internal data structures that are dependent on properties and then calling the finalizeFromProperties() on its (sub)components. finalizeFromProperties() was made public and non-virtual and a private base method added to do its addition of resources. A protected virtual extendFinalizeFromProperties() is now what derived Components must implement (not finalizeFromProperties) to extend/specialize new Component types. Super::extendFinalizeFromProperties() is to legitimately give its Super a chance to finalize first without the side-effect of calling subcomponents. Component separately invokes finalizeFromProperties on each of its (sub)components after the Component. Component's finalizeFromProperties() also marks the Component(Object)'s _objectIsUpToDate flag as true.

bd759f9e6a1c8997e8b5588deb730c87c53398d9,opensim-org/opensim-core,"Update to testComponents to make it more general and make it automatically test all components for their ""structural"" integrity. That is they can: clone, de/serialize, connect to an aggregate via connectors, add themselves to a system, contribute to state initialization and can do so without leaking more than 1/10% of their initial memory footprint. These can be tightened more once we find the source of these small leaks.

All registered Components can be run through this harness but the majority fail the test. Therefore, a more systematic approach was adopted where Components are being run through by type with Body and Joint being the first to be cleared. An example of an updated PointToPointSpring (Force) is provided for adding additional Components. This is a step forward on issue #66 and is more automated especially since Connectors are handled by creating and adding the dependency of the correct type.

Other changes:
1. Renamed constructStructuralConnector(s) to just constructConnector since a Connector is defined to be a slot/socket to support (structural) dependencies on other Components.
2. CustomJoint was modified so that constructCoordinates no longer makes copies of Coordinates (savedCoordinates). This lead to references to Coordinates being stale.
3. Discovered that RollingOnSurfaceConstraint test was pointless (nothing was being tested) and so a real test that compares to a collection of Simbody constraints was added to testConstraints.

Things to do:
1. Update other Component types so they successfully pass through this harness. Most require their dependencies to be made explicit via Connectors instead of just having property strings for names of the dependencies.
2. Add tests for Inputs and Outputs
3. Test error handling in cases that a Connector or Input cannot be satisfied.

This PR was merged into the 1.0.x-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Fix `fix` command to handle `--fixers` option when contains extra and excluding fixers

Currently, when `--fixers` option contains extra and excluding mixed filters such as `-eol_ending,concat_with_spaces`, excluding filter will be enabled, however, extra filter will not be enabled.

This PR fixes this behavior, so enable both type filters when mixed filters given.

Braintree was not capturing discounts, instead using the amount in the
original authorization for the capturing. This update changes the
amount to the paymentMethod.amount, which includes discounts.

* removed code used to skip over 24 hour braintree delay (for testing)

* Rename braintreeapi.js to braintreeApi.js

* display absolute number of adjustedTotal

due to various instances of rounding numbers for display purposes, the
adjustedTotal would sometimes display -0.00, as the adjusted total was
technically -.00000000000000000000001, even though we display 0.00 when
we round it. This update just shows the absolute number, as this is
simple a display number and does not have any affect on what is being
sent to and from the payment provider.

* updated schema to match supported payment methods

The current Schema had a 16 number minimum for credit cards, however
braintree supports cards which have number lengths ranging from 12-19

* fix refunds and discounts for authorize.net (#1279)

- Fix discounts so that they are correctly sent to authorize.net

- Allow 100% discounts by adding the “voidTransaction” function and
voiding transactions

- Update error messaging for Refunds, as we do not (yet) allow them
from Authorize.net

* Fix Stripe refunds and Double Discounts (#1304)

* added comment to explain voiding vs applying discount

* add ___ for correctly calculating Stripe adjusted totals

Stripe doesn’t “do” discounts, instead they take the discount sent to
them, and apply it as a refund. This was causing any discounts to show
up twice - once as a discount, once as a refund - in our adjusted
total. This update fixes that by re-adding the discount price into the
adjusted total when the payment provider is Stripe.

* also 100% discounts on Stripe

466581ee06d4d873fafe1014b9d7e3dcd1f8fd93,unitystation/unitystation,"Major performance improvements and hiding player fixes

This commit doubles the FPS of the game build. It also improves the
player sync with server by removing the server updates from a SyncVar
and makes it use a sequenced realible channel instead. This also
completes the Hide in Cupboard feature for players.

Changes:
- Deactivated all redundant cameras (background and interact) and added
the layers back on main cam
- Added UpdateManager to control “tickrate” of objects with
Update/LateUpdate/FixedUpdate. For more info see the readme in
Script/Managers/UpdateManager/
- Move serverstate sync from a SyncVar Hook and to using ClientRpc’s
instead. This has improved the movement of other players on a client
but still there is a few hicups as the state doesn’t arrive in time
(player stops for a split second)
- The closetplayerhandler now moves the deactivated player with the
closet allowing the player to interact with the cupboard (jumping out
if it is unlocked while it is being pulled)

We had _two `IxSet` wrappers, one introduced by Alfredo, and one introduced by
me. Alfredo and I agreed to migrate the code over to the one I introduced, as
it is bit more feature complete. The most important improvement that my `IxSet`
wrapper introduces is that it doesn't require `Eq` or `Ord` instances for the
elements in the set, but instead introduces a concept of a ""primary key"", and
compares primary keys only, for better performance.

This updates the code base to use the (new) `IxSet` wrapper throughout. It
still allows for an `IxSet` of V1 addresses, which we really should not do, but
that's a problem for a separate PR (and a separate ticket: CBR-356).

c906137ea93bb32c8d37f44d4fa8ce51eb212f64,input-output-hk/cardano-sl,"[CBR-146] Rewrite generators and test infra

This is a big commit that makes significant improvements to the generators and
the testing infrastructure.

* Add validator for `Inductive`

The validator is marking the input as invalid, so the problem is probably in
the generator, not the wallet models.

* Identity problems in the existing block tree generator

Note that the old generator is completely replaced; the new generator follows
the old one in approach and takes over ideas, but is significantly different in
the details.

* During input selection, no special provision was made for the case where the
  UTxO got empty during generation.
* Output selection was for some unknown reason also based on the UTxO, but
  output selection does not seem to be related to unspent _inputs_. Instead the
  generator is now given a set of addresses it can choose from at any point.
* Output selection was not filtering out AVVM accounts.
* When generating the transactions for the next level in the tree, all
  transactions were created using the same UTxO, not accounting for the fact
  that once we generate a transaction that uses some of the inputs in that
  UTxO, other transactions can not use those anymore.
* After selecting a random subset of the available transactions at this level
  of the tree, we then nonetheless used the _full_ set, but computed the UTxO
  based on the subset.
* Similarly, synthesizeTransactions also made the same mistake of using
  the UTxO for output generation.
* When we were selecting a subset of the generated transactions to be included
  in a particular branch, we were repeatedly selecting from the same total set
  of transactions, potentially selecting duplicate transactions.
* The flattening from trees to actions (with rollbacks) was incorrect.

* Refactor Inductive

This turns `Inductive` to a list of wallet events. We needed this in some
places already, and ended up with two variations on `Inductive`, which wasn't
very satisfactory. Moreover, the blocktree generator probably needs yet another
variation again. With this new definition they can all use the same construct.
It also happens to clear up a nasty bit of code in the DSL-versus-cardano
wallet interpreter.

This does not update all the code, since I'm planning to replace the
`Inductive` generator.

* Refactor: split Abstract into submodules

* Rewrite UTxO/Inductive generators

This takes advance of CBR-262 to avoid the DSL-Cardano roundtrip to compute
transaction fees, which allows us to simplify things significantly. It also
splits the generators more cleanly into blockchain generators and inductive
wallet generators. Moreover, the inductive wallet generator now generates calls
to `NewPending` from the get-go, rather than inserting them after the fact
(which was a lot more difficult to do with rollbacks).

* Improve tests, fix bug in full model

This makes a number of improvements to the testing infrastructure

* Fee estimation is no longer hardcoded but passed as an argument
* Better pretty-printer for transaction outputs
* Simplified definition of 'ours' in the abstract wallet definition
  (it was `a -> Maybe SomeKeyPair`, now it's just `a -> Bool`)
* Added `expectedUtxo` to the abstract wallet model, and used this to state the
  invariant that the utxo and the expected UTxO must be disjoint.
  NOTE: This invariant currently breaks due to bug in spec.
* Added `dumpState` to abstract wallet model to faciliate debugging, and
  added pretty-printers for the states of all the wallet models.
* Differentiate between applicable invariants for no rollbacks,
  basic rollback model and full rollback model.
* Fixed bug in the implementation of the full model which didn't change
  the definition of `change` to take dependent pending transactions into
  account. The tests were catching this now (yay!).
* Generalized the testing infrastructure so that we can instantiate it
  easily to a simple model with simple addresses, as well as the real
  model that matches what happens in Cardano.

NOTE: Disabled the new invariant for now, until we fix the spec.

* Clean up testing of the kernel

This now completes the refactoring of the testing infrastructure. All tests
show green, and now include rollback!

(The invariant that is broken due to bug in the spec is commented out for the
time being.)

The notifier abstraction is more powerful than the inter tab channel

The notifierMixin provides functionality to a view to

```js
...
notifications: {
  'msg-name': '_handler',
  'other-msg-name': function () {
    // handle message here
  }
},
```

All notification handlers are automatically unregistered when an object
is destroyed.

Part of this work includes moving models/notifications.js to

5f7000e185fca71a5077ae7e2bcd29450c4cb70f,openstack/openstack-ansible,"Improve ansible host & venv bootstrap

The current ansible bootstrap process tried to
pin the versions of pip, setuptools and wheel
on the host and also uses inherited python
packages from the host. This causes problems
when the host has a version of setuptools which
is cannot be changed (perhaps due to some bug)
or when the host has otherwise undesirable
python packages.

The ansible bootstrap process only needs to
be concerned with whether pip is installed
and understands how to use constraints.

From there we can bootstrap the venv using
get-pip and completely avoid package conflicts
with the host. Once Ansible is bootstrapped,
the pip_install role will ensure that pip,
setuptools and wheel are correctly bootstrapped
and pinned across all hosts.

The pip_install role now uses constraints for
the initial get-pip [1], so we can also remove
the list of pip pins from group_vars.

We remove pip, setuptools and wheel from the
requirements.txt to allow the packages on the
host to be installed in the bootstrap without
forcing a change of pip/setuptools/wheel at the
same time (which causes failures in some
circumstances).

I use the term ""finish"" loosely since I'm sure we'll need further functionality once we support support multiple CBs.

1. Change SunPosition to a class instead of a static object.
2. Rename `compute` to `update`; `update` does not return any data but rather sets properties on the `SunPosition` instance.
3. Flesh out documentation.
4. Optimize performance and reduce memory pressure.  We no longer create throw-away instances.
5. Update CHANGES

If for some reason we're not happy about changing this to a class, we can change it back to a function, but instead of returning an object literal, I would instead just return the Sun's position and people can compute the other values from that; this way we don't have to worry about creating a new object literal every time we compute.  We only use position in the code right now anyway.

658077b77701e524f609afab964835715bb0a793,AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium,"Use dimensions, instead of min/max corners, for BoxGraphics

In order to be more consistent with other Entity geometries, such as
cylinder and ellipsoid, this changes BoxGraphics to use
`position`, `orientation`, and `dimensions` properties instead of
`minimumCorner` and `maximumCorner` properties.  This also allows for
rotated boxes, which the previous behavior did not.  This also opens up
the possibility for a dynamic box fast-path, similar to what we do for
ellipsoid, if the need ever arises.

We've had a check in Viewer forever to see if the baseLayer picker was
being used when a terrainProvider or imageryProvider was specified.  This
lead to a tone of code where we create the viewer and then just specify
viewer.terrainProvider anyway. Basically, this check was pointless and
just made the code more verbose.  The check also prevented devs from
specifing a terrainProvider but still using BaseLayerPicker for imagery
(and vice versa). Now we just let the user do what they want, which was
probably the right call from the beginning.

In order to make #1560 easier to review, this is a handful of simple changes I made elsewhere in the code.

1. Make BoundingSphere implement Packable
2. Add some contructor helper methods to ComponentDataType.
3. Remove unecessary memory allocation in EllipsoidTangentPlane & CzmlDataSource
4. Add a new function, `subdivideArray` for splitting an array into N equal parts.
5. Minor change to DynamicModelVisualizer to avoid paying the ES5 property penalty (until the visualizer is rewritten).

I don't think any of this warranted an update to CHANGES.

e74d261ec33514d2e6ef91e3bf0e9d57d8d28e4c,alphagov/notifications-admin,"Don’t store info about bad uploads in session

Because we now[1] store info about each file upload separately in the
session the session isn’t overridden every time you upload a file. This
is good because you can do multiple file uploads idempotently.

Generally we are cleaning up after ourselves because we pop anything to
do with that upload from the session. However there is an edge case: if
you never send the file then the info about the file stays in the
session in perpetuity[2]. This is generally happening when people are
uploading files that are impossible to send, ie ones that have errors.

So this commit makes two changes:

1. remove info about a file upload from the session as soon as we know
   that it contains errors
2. `POST` reuploads to the same endpoint as initial uploads because
   otherwise we need to keep info about bad uploads in the session,
   which would prevent us from doing 1.

This is dumb. You'd think, given that there's
`config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME']`, that you'd enable permanent
sessions in the config too - but no, you have to declare it for each
request. session.permanent is also, helpfully, a way of saying that the
session isn't permanent - in that, it will expire on its own, as
opposed to being controlled by the browser's session. Because session
is a proxy, it's only accessible from within a request context, so we
need to set this before every request :roll_eyes:

a10071cd97e67b5d1e33c92371744d9db7b301d6,QoboLtd/cakephp-csv-migrations,"Smarter way for field handlers to get value from data

Currently, we have multiple scenarios of passing the field
value to the field handler (`renderValue()`, etc):

* Using `$data` parameter
* Using `$options['entity']` parameter

On top of that, both of these can be either one of the following:

* An Entity instance
* An array from $this->request->data()
* An actual value of the field

In order to simplify the handling of these cases and make them
more consisten, we now do the following:

1. Try to rely on `$data` parameter in all cases.
2. Pass `$data` to `_getFieldValueFromData()` method, which checks
   the type of the variable to be either an instance of Entity,
   and instance of Request, or something else.
3. If the `$data` is empty, then we try to get the value from the
   `$options['entitiy']` if possible.

The last one should eventually be factored out and disappear.  It's
only there because we didn't do the clean data handling in the first
place.

As of today `collective-report`, model and graphql api each have they own way of loading collective transactions. But now we have virtual cards, there's a little business logic we need to add to ensure we load the proper transactions for collective.

When fetching collective transactions with the new function, we will now include:
- Debit transactions made by this collective without using a virtual card
- Debit transactions made using a virtual card from this collective
- Credit transactions made to this collective

Convert WizardStore, WeekStore, and BlockStore to redux

This is a pretty massive refactor that replaces the Flux stores for handling the assignment wizard and the timeline with redux.

Along the way, there are also a few minor bugs that I discovered and fixed, but this is mostly a refactor that keeps the behavior the same.

WeekStore and BlockStore are replaced by a combined timeline reducer, since those two stores were so closely interdependent anyway. The data format for the new reducer is still a little awkward, like the previous one was, but I've tried to streamline it somewhat. Weeks and blocks are still stored separately in objects (with week/block IDs as the keys), even though the expected format for all the component is an array of weeks, with each week including the array of blocks included. This transformation is now handled through the getWeeksArray selector, which rebuilds the weeks with the blocks that belong to that week whenever the blocks object gets updated. All rendering and syncing with the server uses the weeks array from that selector. The separate object of blocks is only used within the selector for constructing the weeks array, and the corresponding `persisted` objects are only used internally within the reducer to handle resetting of unsaved changes."

The front-end login screens use the label ""Username""

Also, I put the ""Download Form 21-534"" on its own close to the second bullet since it's directly tied to that one, and then put ""Find out if you qualify..."" and ""Get military service records"" links slightly below with another break since those 2 apply to both conditionals in the bullets.

f4e67458e275ea6f446ef1eba77037517cd12449,wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-MobileFrontend,"Hygiene: Refactor Notification code - add NotificationBadge class

The code is very brittle here as the NotificationOverlay
communicates with the NotificationBadge. NotificationOverlay assumes
HTML markup rather than uses reliable methods to communicate changes.

This formalises their relationship.

To render the badge on the client the secondaryButton template is
now shipped to the client.

Tests have been added to cover behaviour.
The module lives in skins.minerva.notifications.badge to avoid pulling
all skins.minerva.notifications modules into the environment which can
lead to side effects due to the unconditional wiring up many of these modules
do to the existing HTML. It is not added to mobile.notifications.overlay to
avoid pulling OOjs UI into the startup JavaScript.

Additional changes:
* Migrate Minerva specific onResourceLoaderRegisterModules code
into Minerva.hooks
* Now loadModuleScript lives inside NotificationBadge revert to using
loader.using - this also has the benefit of not removing the notification
badge icon in the top right corner
* Drop the .zero display:none rule as now only one of the badges is rendered
at any given time.

Assumption: touch-based devices users are much less likely to use use a
physical keyboard (Tab) for navigation.

Also, remove redundant CSS rules for disabling the outline in other
places and use outline: 0 instead of outline: none which seems to be
correct according to specs. [1]

This introduces a few changes:

* /tests/javascripts follows the directory structure of /javascripts.

* onResourceLoaderTestModules hook automatically checks if there is a
  test file for every JavaScript file we use in our ResourceLoader
  modules and if it finds it, creates a corresponding RL test module.
  No more dependency problems when adding new JavaScript test files!

* Messages and templates are loaded for tests just as they are loaded in
  the extension itself (hence the changes in test_mf-photo.js,
  test_carousel.js and test_mf-navigation.js)).

* Our JavaScript tests now have to be run using mobile version of
  Special:JavaScriptTest page, this also ensures they run in the
  environment they were written for.

* Sinon.js updated to 1.6.0.

There are a couple of hacks in place
* mobile.tests.base is prefixed with a 0. to force earlier loading. On
Jon's Mac Air this was loading after mobile.toggling module

* The settings tests set a cookie for 400ms. By the time the check was
run this cookie had expired so the limit was increased.

jshint is now integrated into jenkins
so let's take advantage

add config file and Makefile helper
(note Makefile specifically targets all subdirectories except
external as we cannot guarantee external js will follow our
standards)
remove jslint config from top of js files as this seems
to conflict with .jshintrc
update pre-commit hook to run jshint
(note I originally tried make tests but there seems to be an
issue with running this from a different directory)

update documentation in README

Patch set 4: I edited .jshintrc. It didn't check the global or undefined
variables at all. Also, all options default to false so no need to
specify them, maxerr doesn't seem to have any effect. Added unused and
some custom globals (it seems we need mw). (jgonera)

Certain modules are used to setup features/routes (e.g. bind
to certain hash fragments) or to progressively enhance the page.

This splits those out to make it clearer and cleans up their dependencies
in the process (if a parent has a dependency it doesn't need to be restated)

When enabled this replaces the list of references with
a link to a non-existent special page which is passed
the parameters it needs to render the list of referenes

When a reference is clicked it fires off a request to the API
to get the references object.

This needs various changes in the Cite API which are listed
below.

Changes:
* When feature flag enabled sub and sup tags are hidden. URLS for
these will be rewritten when Special:References fallback is in place
* setup function of references module  now requires the page object
* getReference private method now requires page to be passed
* Introduce private method getReferenceData which obtains
references via API or from DOM depending on feature flag
* mobile.references now uses the editor gateway so it can parse
reference raw wikitext (hopefully this can be removed at later date)
* Refactor tests for reference to use a template and not trigger
DOM events
* New style module added for beta skin
* Error handling when reference lookup fails
